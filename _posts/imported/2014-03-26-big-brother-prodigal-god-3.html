<div class="MsoNormal">2014/03/23 Christ Church, Mountain Top</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Prayer, Psalm 63<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Children, John 4<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Message, Luke 15.25-32<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Most of the time, when we look at this story, the story traditionally known as “The Parable of the Prodigal Son”, we concentrate on the account of the younger brother.&nbsp; He disgraces his father and family, squanders his inheritance in riotous living, and returns home to an incredible and unexpected welcome.&nbsp; One old preacher described those wild days in the far country with the phrase, “he rambled, he scrambled, he gambled”.&nbsp; It is easy to label that as sinful, and it is clear that his welcome home is an act of grace.&nbsp; But if we stop there, we miss out on two things: the cost of that grace (next week) and the other character in the story, the “big brother”.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; text-indent: .25in;">“Big brother”?&nbsp; The phrase conjures up images of control and conformity – the perfect terms for the life and spirituality of the older brother!&nbsp; Like the little brother, he is “lost”.&nbsp; No, he hasn’t “acted out”.&nbsp; No, he hasn’t sown any “wild oats”.&nbsp; Yes, he’s really, really good.&nbsp; No, he’s not much fun to be around.&nbsp; Instead of sin keeping him from the father and from God, it is his righteousness that becomes the barrier.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Most of the time when we read this story, our focus is on the younger brother.&nbsp; It is a beautiful and sentimental story that, in the mouth of a lesser story teller than Jesus, would end with the catch phrase: “And they all lived happily ever after.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that real life isn’t quite as clean cut, easy, or understandable.&nbsp; Life is good, and there’s always “something.”&nbsp; Big brother is plainly unhappy at the welcome of the father, just as the scribes and Pharisees are unhappy at Jesus’ welcome of the tax collectors and sinners.&nbsp; And, he has every right to be!&nbsp; What the father is doing in the story is unheard of!&nbsp; In an honor-shame society, when you have dishonored the family you are banished, if not dead.&nbsp; “We are dead to you.”&nbsp; Even the possibility of taking him back as a hired hand would be a huge stretch after the younger brother had basically wished his father dead: “Give me my share of the inheritance – now.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We like the “happily ever after” ending, but it simply does not fit with the story.&nbsp; The father welcomes back the younger son – something reckless and extravagant, certainly not a gesture that could be described with our small-minded virtue of “being nice”.&nbsp; No, this is over-the-top.&nbsp; And, it has a huge impact on big brother, who looks at his inheritance and imagines it diminishing by the father’s extravagance.&nbsp; No wonder he wants nothing to do with the party.&nbsp; He doesn’t want to be in the same family with “this son of yours” (Luke 15.30).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">But when I pay attention to the younger brother, to what he does and says, indignation and disgust rise within me.&nbsp; He’s arrogant, rude, shameless, self-absorbed, out of control, stupid, lacking discipline.&nbsp; Good riddance!&nbsp; My heart doesn’t break for him, I don’t find myself moved with love or compassion.&nbsp; Dad is far too nice.&nbsp; Have you ever heard of tough love?&nbsp; I’d be saying, “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my imagination, the younger brother, before he left home, makes a habit of coming home in the wee hours hung over, with a girl or a friend – equally inebriated – in tow.&nbsp; In my imagination, he sleeps in, skips out on farm chores, shows up only to eat and sleep, then heads out to paint the town red.&nbsp; In my imagination, the first times this happened, dad was sleeping uneasily on the couch, jumping up when the kid got home, saying, “Where were you?&nbsp; Why didn’t you call?”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not the dynamic this time.&nbsp; As long as the son has been gone, the father expected to get an obituary by mail or phone – alcohol poisoning, bar fight, drug overdose, DUI accident.&nbsp; The father says, “This son of mine was dead and is alive again” (Luke 15.24).&nbsp; No “Where were you?”&nbsp; Only, “He was lost and is found”.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Now, my imagination of the younger brother before he leaves home is, quite simply, “not in the book”.&nbsp; What we have, in the book, is a rejoicing father and an angry big brother.&nbsp; The big brother is angry because he’s never gotten this kind of treatment for all his years of compulsive goodness.&nbsp; Dad reminds him, “All I have is yours” (that is, since the little brother already got his inheritance, everything else goes to the big brother).&nbsp; We don’t know the big brother’s response – Jesus leaves the story unresolved – but the father’s statement raises one more objection.&nbsp; The lavish feast, a feast likely thrown for the entire community (how else do you eat a calf?), is at the expense of the big brother’s inheritance!&nbsp; And, what if the father has in mind to make this younger brother an heir once again?&nbsp; Would he go that far?&nbsp; Again, the story doesn’t take us there, but you can almost hear the adding machine in the big brother’s head.&nbsp; As Tim Keller emphasizes, “He wanted the father’s wealth, but not the father.”&nbsp; His younger brother was not just a disgrace to the family but also an expense he did not want to bear.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The older brother is lost.&nbsp; He refuses to be in a family with a sinner, and God welcomes sinners.&nbsp; Keller says it this way: “The difference between a religious person and a true Christian is that the religious person obeys God to get control over God, and things from God, but the Christian obeys just to get God, just to love and please and draw closer to him.&nbsp; Some people are complete elder brothers.&nbsp; They go to church and obey the Bible– but out of expectation that then God owes them.&nbsp; They have never understood the Biblical gospel at all.&nbsp; But many Christians, who know the gospel, are nonetheless elder-brother<i>ish.</i>&nbsp; Despite the fact that they know the gospel of salvation by grace with their heads, their hearts go back to an elder-brotherish ‘default mode’ of self-salvation” (Keller, notes for pastors).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the context of our traditional focus on the younger brother, this comes as a startling, and perhaps offensive, statement: The older brother in the story is lost.&nbsp; There are two main elements of the story that reveal the lostness of the older son.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the son, in his argument with dad, says, “For all these years I’ve been working like a slave for you” (Luke 15.29).&nbsp; In the theology and story of Israel, this is a reference to Exodus, to Israel delivered from slavery in Egypt.&nbsp; Years after the Exodus, the prophet Jeremiah declares, in question form, “Is Israel a slave?” (Jeremiah 2.14).&nbsp; We are, Jeremiah asserts, delivered and saved people.&nbsp; We shouldn’t go back to slavery, we shouldn’t give up on grace.&nbsp; As the apostle Paul writes, “It is for freedom Christ has set us free.&nbsp; Stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5.1).&nbsp; Yet, big brother, who should have been enjoying the grace of the father, is living like a slave.&nbsp; He needs to be delivered, he needs to be saved.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, over and over in the Scripture and in Jesus’ teaching, salvation and life in the kingdom of God is described as a feast or party.&nbsp; The prophet Isaiah promises, “On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food” (Isaiah 25.6).&nbsp; When Jesus eats his last Passover meal (a celebration of the Exodus deliverance) with his disciples, he says, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, for I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God” (Luke 22.15-16).&nbsp; And, here in Luke 15, we are twice told of the “joy in heaven” over “one sinner who repents”.&nbsp; What’s going on at the feast of the father?&nbsp; They are rejoicing over “one sinner who repents.” &nbsp;It’s an image of heaven!&nbsp; And the big brother is outside, refusing to go in, arguing with dad.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This story has huge implications for our mission as well.&nbsp; We talk about our mission as to “make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world”.&nbsp; That is a primary way that the Scriptures phrase the mission of God’s people.&nbsp; There are other ways the Scriptures describe it, among them to participate in Jesus’ mission: “As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you” (John 20.21).&nbsp; And, in Luke’s gospel, Jesus describes his mission as “to seek and save the lost” (Luke 19.10).&nbsp; Big brothers have no interest in lost people.&nbsp; They are only interested in good people.&nbsp; No wonder Christians and churches have a reputation of being judgmental – we’ve got a lot of big brother going on.&nbsp; We give lip service to grace, but we work to earn our way.&nbsp; We give lip service to reaching new people, but we really just want people like us.&nbsp; Changing for the sake of our mission?&nbsp; Going beyond the four walls to truly “seek” others?&nbsp; Remembering that it is all about Jesus, and not at all about me?&nbsp; So tough for the older brother in us.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The story is told of a heated argument at a church board meeting.&nbsp; Finally, an exasperated board member slams his fist on the table and declares, “I just want what I deserve”.&nbsp; At which point, one of his colleagues told him exactly where to go.&nbsp; Not kind, but theologically accurate, and therein lies the humor.&nbsp; No matter how good we are, we cannot earn or deserve our salvation. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; text-indent: .25in;">Big brother is lost, only he doesn’t know it.&nbsp; And that makes his condition all the more dangerous for him.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the father goes out to plead with him.&nbsp; And Jesus ends the story with the invitation.&nbsp; It is his way of saying to us that the door remains open even if we are going to debate with him exactly who does and who does not deserve his favor.&nbsp; It is his way of saying to the Pharisees, whose role in the story is played by the big brother, that their righteousness is a barrier between them and God and that they are still invited into the kingdom.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus challenges religion.&nbsp; When we’re lost, we need to be found – we don’t “find” ourselves.&nbsp; When we’re righteous, we still need God.&nbsp; Our good deeds don’t earn entrance to the kingdom of God.&nbsp; Jesus challenges religion because it puts control, false control, in our hand.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, religion killed Jesus.&nbsp; The religious experts and the political establishment, neither wishing to give up control, conspired together to arrest and execute him.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">As he died, Jesus called out, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23.34).&nbsp; As Keller writes, “Knowing what he did for us must drain us of our self-righteousness and our insecurity.&nbsp; We were so sinful that he <i>had</i> to die for us.&nbsp; But we were so loved that he was <i>glad</i>to die for us.&nbsp; That takes away both the pride and the fear that makes us elder brothers” (notes for pastors).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Timothy Keller, <i>The Prodigal God,</i> and notes for pastors<o:p></o:p></div>
