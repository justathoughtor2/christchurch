Some of the texts include it here or in two other places in John’s gospel. One family of texts places it in Luke’s gospel. And, within the story itself, there are some variations of the text, more than typical. This is the only “free-floating” (Culpepper, 170) text that shows up in the Bible and there is a good bit of scholarly conversation on this topic. I read four different academic commentaries on the text and each one of them had a different approach to the authority and history of this text. I am not addressing that today, only acknowledging it. It’s in the book, and we’re using it. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do want to make one comment on the general question of textual accuracy of the Scriptures, because I have heard from so many folks that, “You know, you just can’t trust the reliability of the text. Probably early Christians changed things to make it read the way they wanted.” There is absolutely no evidence that is the case. In fact, the New Testament includes so many stories and texts that posed difficulties for the first readers, and they kept those difficulties in the text. There are multiple variants, yes. That’s because this text, our Bible, was so loved and reverenced that it was copied thousands of times by hand and preserved and read by communities all over the world. Having these multiple copies has made it possible for scholars to reconstruct the textual history of the New Testament to an accuracy of over 99.9%. So, when you hear someone say, “Well, we just don’t know what the text originally said”, you don’t need to start an argument and you don’t need to doubt. Some comparisons: The earliest copies of the works of Greek historian Herodotus come 1300 after the originals were written, in the year 900, and there are only 8 early copies from that time. The earliest copies of Caesar’s <i>Gaelic War</i> are 950 years after the originals were written, again in the year 900, and there are only 10 copies from that time. The New Testament writings were widely circulated during the lifetime of the first witnesses to Jesus, and despite being written after Herodotus and Caesar, the earliest copies date to 130, and we have discovered over 25,000 manuscripts all of which date within the first 310 years! (Nicky Gumbel, 8).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Today’s theme is judgment, and there is so much to discuss around judgment. As we wrap up our “Holy Mess” series, we remember that on so many of these issues we have discussed – human sexuality, human life, church and state, science and faith – we line up against each other in judgment, as if in firing lines. My hope has been that we would learn to “be of one heart while not of one mind” (John Wesley). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes judgment is all about what I do to myself. I’m not good enough at this. I performed poorly at that. I lost my temper. I was rude, and it doesn’t matter that I am really tired – I was just rude. I’ll never be what I hope to be.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes judgment is all about the way we organize people – each with a unique story – into categories, into boxes, for easy sorting as “good” or “bad”. Each person gets a label. The language of judgment, of labels, is such a huge part of our vocabulary. Even if we don’t utter the words out loud in public, the idea, the phrase, crawls through our brains. We say them or think them when someone cuts us off in traffic or does one of a countless other things that frustrate. Most of these pejorative expressions are focused on observed behavior.<o:p></o:p><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is even easier to pass judgment. Who needs behavior? We can do it with mostly superficial characteristics – skin color, gender, social class, religious inclination, political affiliation. Years ago, Robin was in the grocery store line chatting with the gal in front of her. “We’re new in the area. My husband’s a pastor.” “A pastor,” she said with ears perked up. “What church?” “The United Methodist Church.” “Oh.” End of conversation. We clearly weren’t her kind of Christian. Robin wasn’t rude, had not done anything offensive. We had an invisible label, but once it was “out” there was no keeping us out of the “bad” box.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my hopes in this series of messages was for us to expand the conversations we have around these questions, to recognize – even in persons who disagree with us – a sister or brother in Christ. I was recently reading an article on leadership and casting vision for social change which focused on how important it is to listen to different ideas. The writers used the phrase, “an echo chamber of the like-minded”, and pointed out that when we live in such an echo chamber, when all we hear is what reinforces our own ideas, we become (no surprise!) more set in our opinion instead of actually understanding the controversial subject better (Lavizzo-Mourey &amp; Mann). If we want to understand these matters on a higher level, we must be willing to be pushed, we must push ourselves to learn. On a number of the questions we have addressed, The United Methodist Church has taken some clear public stands. But we remain a diverse church, something I personally appreciate. It has helped me move out of the echo-chamber. I hope that I do not do to other Christians what was done to Robin in that grocery store.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This story from John 8 is full of judgment and judgment language. A woman is caught in adultery. The man is noticeably missing. Did he jump out the window or was the whole thing a set-up? Our imagination is invited. “Moses told us to kill her by throwing stones at her. What do you say, Jesus?” <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the judgment of this woman, already betraying a clear double standard since the man is missing, is now revealed to be what it truly is – a pretext – a way to judge Jesus. On the face of it, no matter how Jesus answers he is wrong. He can argue in support of Moses and defy Roman law, which did not officially permit Jews to execute capital punishment. He can argue against Moses and defy Jewish tradition and, possibly, a mob out for blood. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, there are deeper matters at stake, Jesus’ essential identity. St. Augustine imagines the plan of Jesus’ antagonists: <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">If he says, “Let her be stoned,” we shall say to him, “What has become of your forgiving sins? Aren’t you the one who says ‘Your sins are forgiven you?’” But if he says, “Let her go,” we shall say, “What has become of your coming to fulfill the law and not to destroy it?” (Sermon 16A.4, cited in Elowsky, 275).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">As in last week’s story, the intent is to impale Jesus on the horns of a dilemma. Jesus bends down to write in the dirt, ignoring their insistent pestering. Then, the perfect retort: “Whoever is without sin, you be the first to throw a stone” (8.7). Showing a little respect to the crowd, he bends again to his task of writing in the dirt. No need to look people in the eye when you have exposed their naked power play, pulled the curtain on their double standards, and called the bluff of their indignant justice. Over-exposed, they all leave until the woman is alone with Jesus. “May they be wrapped in their own shame as in a mantle” (Psalm 109).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Augustine again: <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">The two were left alone, the <i>miserable and Mercy</i> (translation changed by me, Latin, <i>misera et misericordia,</i> Brown, 337). . . . They left the woman with her great sin in the keeping of him who was without sin. And because she had heard, “He that is without sin, let him cast the first stone at her,” she most likely expected to be punished by one in whom no sin could be found. But he who had repelled her adversaries with the voice of justice lifted her on the eyes of mercy (Elowsky, 277).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">“Mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2.13).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Chris Rosebrough is a pastor in North Dakota and the “captain” of Pirate Christian Radio, with the mottos “The truth will set ye free” and “Heretics beware!” His website markets the Pirate Christian Radio as “an online radio station that is free from the scurvy plagues of pop-psychology, goofy fads, self-help, pietism, purpose-drivenism, the prosperity heresy, contemplative mysticism, seeker-sensitivism, liberalism, relavantism, Emergent nonsense, and the sissy girly Oprah-fied religiosity that is being passed off as ‘Biblical Christianity.’ This station defends <i>the</i>historic Christian faith” (Bolz-Weber, 109). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, there’s Nadia Bolz-Weber, pastor of House for All Sinners and Saints, a church that started with eight people, four of them queer (119). She’s brilliant and funny – a former stand-up comic whose call to ministry came as she was presiding at a funeral for a friend, in the comedy club in which they both performed. Her website is “The Sarcastic Lutheran”. Here’s how she describes Rosebrough: “His ‘I represent the pure doctrine of the one true faith and here is why everyone but us is wrong, wrong, wrong’ shtick plays to a devoted and adoring audience who may or may not be also stockpiling weapons, canned food, and Bibles in their backyard bomb shelters” (109). I think there’s plenty of sarcasm, and plenty of judgment, to go around.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bolz-Weber was one of Rosebrough’s targets; he devoted twenty minutes in one broadcast to describing her false teachings at length. Then these two enemies met each other at a conference. He said, “It’s weird, Nadia. We obviously disagree about a lot, but something tells me that out of all these liberal Christians, you and I have a couple things we might agree on.” They had a long conversation, which Bolz-Weber described as “spiritual waterboarding (Jesus holding my head under the waters of my own baptism until I cry uncle).” And she remarked to Rosebrough, “Maybe you and I are desperate enough to hear the Gospel that we can even hear it from each other” (112-113). To the surprise of many, themselves included, Pirate Christian and Sarcastic Lutheran, these enemies, became friends.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">The two were left alone, the <i>miserable and Mercy</i>. . . . He who had repelled her adversaries with the voice of justice lifted her on the eyes of mercy (Augustine; Elowsky, 277).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Note: Sin is still sin, still harmful, still isolating, still bad for you. Jesus does not condemn the woman, for he has come not to condemn the world but to save it (John 3.17, see also 8.15 and Bruce, 413, 417). However, he tells her, “Go, and do not sin again” (8.11, RSV). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus has transformed judgment by mercy. “Mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2.13). He writes on the ground, and the imaginations of Christian interpreters are alive with many possibilities for exactly what he wrote. I think it is helpful to remember two other times in the Bible story when God physically wrote. First, God wrote the words of the covenant, in particular the ten commandments, on stone tablets for Moses and Israel: “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol…. You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God…. Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy…. Honor your father and your mother…. You shall not murder…. You shall not commit adultery” (Exodus 20.2-14f). Covenant, prohibitions, and the basis of judgment.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, in the book of Daniel, a mysterious hand appears and writes a riddle on a wall in the middle of the king’s party. Daniel is brought in to give the interpretation: “God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end. You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting” (Daniel 5). Judgment.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, here in John’s gospel. Jesus bends down and writes. He transforms judgment. It is an opportunity for enemies to become friends, for sinners to become siblings, for those estranged to be embraced. The Bible word is “reconciliation”. Sin is still sin, and we are still sinners. Sin is still hated by God, precisely because we sinners are so dearly loved by Jesus. Sin is dangerous. Sin hurts us, and others. Sin destroys lives. Sin is bad for you. I love my children. And, I’ve hated their sin, because their sin separates them from me, from each other, and from God. I will admit to gloating a few times when I caught them red-handed. “I know everything. Who’s your daddy?” <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I’m not Jesus. It’s pretty difficult for me to be honest about sin and really love someone. If I like the person, I’d much rather smile and ignore the sin conversation. If I don’t like them, then I’m free to be a hater. At times, I am prideful or ignorant enough to think that I’m just too cute for anyone to be concerned about my sin (not even God), OR that I’m just so wretched and miserable that no one could have mercy on me (not even God). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this story, Jesus is surrounded by sinners. There’s the woman, whose sin has a public label. Then, there’s the accusers and gloaters, the double-standard dudes, the indignantly just. Jesus does not accuse or gloat. Jesus, the sinless one, does not pick up the first stone. “There is now no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8.1). Jesus bends down to write. He bends down.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Bede reflected that we would do well to follow Jesus’ example: “When we look at some other sinner, we immediately bend down” (Elowsky, 276). It is humility that forms the platform for reconciliation, for enemies to become friends, for people as different as Pirate Christian and Sarcastic Lutheran to hear the Gospel from each other. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">During the final hymn: Invite to pick up a stone. Not to cast it, but to keep it and remember that Jesus, the sinless one, refused to cast the “first stone”.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicky Gumbel. 1995. <i>The Alpha Course Manual.</i> Colorado Springs, CO: Cook Ministry Resources.
