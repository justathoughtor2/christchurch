Right now, we give a little over a tithe. I don’t know exactly how much … we just round up. It has not always been easy. Going to grad school, with two babies at home, on a part time income – difficult. Paying for two college educations at the same time while Robin goes through two periods of unemployment in 15 months – difficult. The college stuff is soon over, the last tuition bill due in December of 2015. And, we’re kind of excited about the possibility of giving more. Then again, “life happens” and you do your best to adjust.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If “life happens” for you, no one from the church is going to hound you about your giving. We just want to be there for you. If your giving is toward the bottom of the chart, and you are tithing, you are living below the poverty line. It is our privilege and duty as God’s people to be with you, to help you. Please let us know.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Every one of these numbers is a story. Our Scripture passages today share two more generosity stories. One is really sad, the story of this rich young man who hears Jesus’ call and goes away “grieving, for he had many possessions” (19.22). What he didn’t realize, at least before he met Jesus, is that his possessions had <i>him.</i> He was possessed by stuff, and he was unwilling to be set free. Jesus’ invitation to generosity was the key to his financial freedom and peace, and he turned Jesus down. His stuff, stuff that doesn’t last, was of more value to him than what lasts forever.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember <i>Mary Poppins?</i> In the course of the film, the boy has tuppence and has to make a choice between using it to buy a bag of bird food from the poor woman in the square OR depositing it at the bank where dad works. The bankers sold their idea of the deposit as a long-term investment, but what they were truly offering (and what they were actually modeling) was dependence on stuff, false security, isolation from poor people and from God’s creation, and no fun at all. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Fidelity Fiduciary Bank”, <i>Mary Poppins<o:p></o:p></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">If you invest your tuppence<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">Wisely in the bank<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">Safe and sound<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">Soon that tuppence, <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">Invested in the bank,<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">Will compound<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">The boy chose to spend his tuppence on bird food.

[Hoarding, paper clips]<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The other generosity story in today’s Scriptures is the story of the poor woman who gave her last two coins, “all she had to live on” (Mark 12.44), worth less than a penny. Jesus says that her gift is larger than anyone else’s, which seems “impossible”. What he is telling us is how God measures generosity. It is not measured by raw amount but by proportionality. Basic giving in the Scripture is proportional – a tithe, or 10%. It is perfectly normal for the amount of your giving to change when your income changes. Though we can still grow in our giving, we can still grow one step by expanding the proportion of our generosity. Amazingly, what Jesus looks for, over and over, is people who give ALL, 100%. This woman gave all. Jesus invited the rich man to give all. Jesus doesn’t ask much. He just asks for all. Again, “impossible”. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Jesus tells his disciples that it is easier for a camel to enter a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom (Matthew 19.24). Now, whether Jesus is speaking about a sewing needle or the “man door” in the larger city gate, also known as “the eye of the needle”, the point is clear – the camel can’t get through. Only the person can … and none of their stuff.<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disciples get the point: “Lord, we have left everything and followed you. What [do we get]?” (19.27) Well, they get part of the point – the call to follow Jesus is a call to leave everything else, to give all. But it is not about their question, “What do we get?” Being a disciple of Jesus requires us to give up being a consumer altogether. We are called to be no more, and no less, than wholly God’s. “Then who can be saved?” (19.25). Of course it is impossible, humanly speaking; but, with God, “all things [that word again] are possible” (19.26). That’s why we need Jesus.<o:p></o:p></div>
