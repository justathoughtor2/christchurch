That group tends to include many young adults, 18- to 35-year-olds who have become dissatisfied with the religions in which they were raised or have never belonged to a traditional church. Research calls this unaffiliated generation the “nones.”</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 25.290000915527344px; word-spacing: 2px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><div class="pagpag1" style="background-color: white; border: 0px; line-height: 25.290000915527344px; margin-bottom: 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; word-spacing: 2px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Recognizing that many “nones” still seek meaning in faith and in community, members of First United Methodist Church, DeLand, voted a few years ago to help start a congregation for those they couldn't reach with modern traditional church services.</span></div><div class="pagpag1" style="background-color: white; border: 0px; line-height: 25.290000915527344px; margin-bottom: 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; word-spacing: 2px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Meanwhile, Pastor Collins and some friends — Clark Orr, Louise Rigdon, Bill and Renee McCullough, Mike Furlong and others — were already working on that. Since 2009, they had been meeting at Cafe DaVinci, the old DeLand Artisan Inn, the former Bonkerz Comedy Club and other local spots that were open to renting or hosting Sunday night services.</span></div><div class="pagpag1" style="background-color: white; border: 0px; line-height: 25.290000915527344px; margin-bottom: 1em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; word-spacing: 2px;"><a href="http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20140628/LIVING/140629513/1065?p=1&amp;tc=pg&amp;tc=ar"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Check out the full story!</span></a></div>
