<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/niGCHIvSzDQ" width="420"></iframe><br /><div class="MsoNormal">2014/11/02 Christ Church, Mountain Top, All Saints, Communion<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Message, Matthew 14.13-21<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I really identify with the disciples in this story. “You give them something to eat.” What?! “We’ve got nothing but five loaves and two fish.” “Bring them here.” And the first verb that is used to describe what Jesus does with the bread is TAKE. But that’s MY lunch! Notice that Matthew doesn’t tell us anything about a little boy offering his meal. In this version of the story, the only children are the childish disciples who seem shocked by the entire experience.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Hoarders: “We’ve got nothing”<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">I’ve never seen the show <i>Hoarders</i>. I think, though, that all of us have a hoarder in us. All of us have stuff that we believe we can’t live without. Money is the thing we hoard (or spend) the most, the thing we most struggle to give away. We also hoard some odd things. For me, it’s paperclips and pens, specifically the Uniball pens I prefer. Robin came to me yesterday at the turkey dinner asking for a pen for someone to write a check. And, I hesitated. She knows me, “Well, I’ll get one from Suzanne’s office.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Have you ever hesitated when Jesus asks, “Bring it to me”? That hesitation reveals our poverty of soul. That hesitation exposes us as hoarders, as slaves to stuff. After all, they might forget to give me my pen back. On the other hand, when we give up our five loaves, when we give up our 10%, when we give up our stuff … we expose ourselves, we become vulnerable. Henri Nouwen expresses the vulnerability this way – “the fear that we cannot be vulnerable without being used” (37). Exposed as a hoarder, or exposed as vulnerable – the choice is ours. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve got nothing. We hoard so carefully that all we can see is what we don’t have. OR – We’ve got nothing. We give so recklessly that we have nothing left. The choice is ours.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We’ve got nothing but five loaves and two fish.” “Bring them here.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Community: “Bring them here”<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">That hesitation to give, that hoarding impulse, isolates us from other people, and even isolates us from God. We may connect, but only in a limited way. We are suspicious of motives. We calculate trustworthiness. All to protect ourselves and our hoard from other people or from Jesus himself. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not our greatest saints: Barbara. Creating community. <o:p></o:p><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not our unexpected saints: UPS driver. If you want to know how I learned to welcome others without judging them, so much of that started with the generosity of a man I judged. Generosity, in the words of Henri Nouwen, invites and involves conversion. And generosity creates community.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice of generosity is about so much more than vulnerability. It is about community and conversion. While other people may need our gifts, God doesn’t need anything from us. Like the parent of a three year old, the gifts God receives do not enrich God. They connect us. And I’ve saved a number of those gifts from my boys because I value the community of our family.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Liars: “We’ve got nothing”<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">The disciples believe they have nothing. At least, for the sake of reporting all the facts, they do inventory the five loaves and two fish, after that contradiction word “but”. “But” that’s really nothing. “But” that doesn’t go far. “But” that’s only enough for one or two if we stretch it. And, as Jesus “takes” the bread, I hear them muttering, “but, but, but”.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of it is a lie. Now, I don’t believe the disciples were intentionally lying. Intentions aside, they were not speaking the truth. Five loaves and two fish are not nothing, certainly not when placed in the hands of Jesus. They were lying, lying to Jesus and deceiving themselves. Not to be too hard on them, I realize that I do exactly the same thing: That ball point pen I picked up at my friend Larry’s church has a pretty neat design and reminds me of Larry. I could get another one at any time, but … There’s that word again!<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, I just didn’t have time.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, don’t I have the right to be happy?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, I just can’t afford to be obedient to the call of Jesus in my life. Maybe we become a little more honest when we phrase it that way. So, I ask myself, what do I need to do so that I can be obedient? What do I need to do so that my five loaves and two fish, my pen and paper clips, my finances, my time, my relationships, my job security … What do I need to do to place it all in the hands of Jesus? Only then will I be telling the truth when I say, “I’ve got nothing” because everything is already given away to Jesus.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Opportunity: “Bring them here”<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">The practice of generosity is about so much more than truth telling and obedience, however. It is about a unique opportunity to participate in the kingdom of God. Jesus didn’t need the loaves and fishes from the disciples. He could have started with stones and sticks. He could have started with nothing. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disciples needed to give. If they had not given, even with all their “buts”, if they had not given, they would have missed the opportunity of participating in the miracle, in the kingdom of God at work. <o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henri Nouwen: God’s kingdom is the place of abundance where every generous act overflows its original bounds and becomes part of the unbounded grace of God at work in the world (Nouwen, 46).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Henri J.
