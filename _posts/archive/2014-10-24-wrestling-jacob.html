<pre style="background-color: #fcfcfc;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">1. Come, 0 thou Traveler unknown, <br /> whom still I hold, but cannot see! <br /> My company before is gone, <br /> and I am left alone with thee; <br /> with thee all night I mean to stay <br /> and wrestle till the break of day. <br /><br />2. I need not tell thee who I am, <br /> my misery and sin declare; <br /> thyself hast called me by my name, <br /> look on thy hands and read it there. <br /> But who, I ask thee, who art thou? <br /> Tell me thy name, and tell me now. <br /><br />3. In vain thou strugglest to get free, <br /> I never will unloose my hold; <br /> art thou the man that died for me? <br /> The secret of thy love unfold; <br /> wrestling, I will not let thee go <br /> till I thy name, thy nature know. <br /><br />4. Wilt thou not yet to me reveal <br /> thy new, unutterable name? <br /> Tell me, I still beseech thee, tell, <br /> to know it now resolved I am; <br /> wrestling, I will not let thee go, <br /> till I thy name, thy nature know. <br /><a name='more'></a><br />5. 'Tis all in vain to hold thy tongue <br /> or touch the hollow of my thigh; <br /> though every sinew be unstrung, <br /> out of my arms thou shalt not fly; <br /> wrestling I will not let thee go <br /> till I thy name, thy nature know. <br /><br />6. What though my shrinking flesh complain <br /> and murmur to contend so long? <br /> I rise superior to my pain: <br /> when I am weak then I am strong, <br /> and when my all of strength shall fail <br /> I shall with the God-man prevail. <br /><br />7. Contented now upon my thigh <br /> I halt, till life's short journey end; <br /> all helplessness, all weakness I <br /> on thee alone for strength depend; <br /> nor have I power from thee to move: <br /> thy nature, and thy name is Love. <br /><br />8. My strength is gone, my nature dies, <br /> I sink beneath thy weighty hand, <br /> faint to revive, and fall to rise; <br /> I fall, and yet by faith I stand; <br /> I stand and will not let thee go <br /> till I thy name, thy nature know. <br /><br />9. Yield to me now-for I am weak <br /> but confident in self-despair! <br /> Speak to my heart, in blessing speak, <br /> be conquered by my instant prayer: <br /> speak, or thou never hence shalt move, <br /> and tell me if thy name is Love. <br /><br />10. 'Tis Love! 'tis Love! thou diedst for me, <br /> I hear thy whisper in my heart. <br /> The morning breaks, the shadows flee, <br /> pure Universal Love thou art: <br /> to me, to all, thy mercies move- <br /> thy nature, and thy name is Love. <br /><br />11. My prayer hath power with God; the grace <br /> unspeakable I now receive; <br /> through faith I see thee face to face, <br /> I see thee face to face, and live! <br /> In vain I have not wept and strove- <br /> thy nature, and thy name is Love. <br /><br />12. I know thee, Savior, who thou art, <br /> Jesus, the feeble sinner's friend; <br /> nor wilt thou with the night depart, <br /> but stay and love me to the end: <br /> thy mercies never shall remove, <br /> thy nature, and thy name is Love. <br /><br />13. The Sun of Righteousness on me <br /> hath risen with healing in his wings: <br /> withered my nature's strength; from thee <br /> my soul its life and succor brings; <br /> my help is all laid up above; <br /> thy nature, and thy name is Love. <br /><br />14. Lame as I am, I take the prey, <br /> hell, earth, and sin with ease overcome; <br /> I leap for joy, pursue my way, <br /> and as a bounding hart fly home, <br /> through all eternity to prove <br /> thy nature, and thy name is Love. </span></pre><pre style="background-color: #fcfcfc;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></pre><pre style="background-color: #fcfcfc;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A hymn by Charles Wesley, which we sang (only 4 verses) in worship.
