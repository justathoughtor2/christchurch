Just want to share these lines from my prayers on Friday, from Psalm 147:<br /><br />Hallelujah!<br />How good it is to sing praises to our God!<br />how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!<br /><br />It reminds me of the joy and pleasure we share together every time we gather for worship. Thanks for coming with hearts open, with gratitude, with expectation. "Where two or three are gathered together, there am I in the midst."&nbsp;We've got a few more than two or three, and God - as promised - shows up.&nbsp;And it is very good.
