<div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 22px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; width: 639.984375px;">June 8 was a bright and happy Sunday at the dedication and opening of Valunia United Methodist Church in the village of Monghere.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Sierra Leone Bishop John K. Yambasu was among the distinguished guests, who also included the Paramount Chief James B.N. Vonjo III, the Queen of the Rosary School marching band and most of the village.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">A mini-mob scene ensued when the doors opened and excited worshipers rushed to fill every plastic chair inside the new sanctuary.</span></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 22px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; width: 639.984375px;">That was one of the first Sundays Yambasu warned the community about Ebola.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 22px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; width: 639.984375px;">Now, months later, the Monghere community knows the grief of losing families and friends to Ebola. But church members still rush through the church doors anytime they open.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">“In situations of distress and calamity, Africans draw closer to God for divine intervention,” Yambasu said. “This is especially so when every attempt to contain Ebola seems not to work.”</span></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 4px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; width: 639.984375px;">On the first Sunday in November, members of Charles Davies United Methodist Church had a dedication service for 40 new chairs purchased by the men of the church. The chairs help with overcrowding.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">“People believe the house of worship is a place of solace,” the Rev. Sahr Fallah said. “So when they feel hopelessness; when they feel all is lost, the only place they can find hope is in the church.”</span></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 4px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; width: 639.984375px;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><b><a href="http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/ebola-drives-united-methodists-to-church-in-west-africa">Read the full story</a></b></span></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 22px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; width: 639.984375px;"><a href="http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/faith-first-at-sierra-leones-kissy-hospital" style="-webkit-transition: all 0.15s linear; background-color: transparent; border: 0px; color: #e4002b; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; transition: all 0.15s linear; width: auto;" target="_blank">Kissy United Methodist Hospital</a>&nbsp;was closed Nov. 11 after Dr. Martin Salia, chief medical officer and surgeon, tested positive for Ebola.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Salia, the sixth doctor in Sierra Leone to be infected with the deadly virus, was taken to the Hastings Ebola Treatment Center near Freetown.</span></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 22px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; width: 639.984375px;">Sierra Leone United Methodist Bishop John K.
