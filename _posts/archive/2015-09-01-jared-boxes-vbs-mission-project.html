The first box was created by a mom whose son, Jared, had to sit for long hours while he waited for his medical treatments. She thought that the activity box would help occupy other children who were dealing with long-term illnesses. A Jared box is a shoe-sized box or container filled with small activity books, playdough, and toys (safe for small children).&nbsp;</span></span>
