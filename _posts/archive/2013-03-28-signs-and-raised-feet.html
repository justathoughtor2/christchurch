I won't put myself in the same league as Francis, but I too, in times of uncertainty, look for signs. (The rest of the time I am too rational for signs - a weakness or a strength?) <br /><br />A week prior, as we were presented with this opportunity, and worried about the loss of what is familiar and good, I noticed that the move announcement at Bethany would coincide with my message on the 6th of Jesus' Last Words on Life from the cross: "It is finished".&nbsp;It was a series of messages planned months prior, and, as always, God goes before. "Eben-ezer" (Hitherto has the LORD helped) and "Jehovah-Jireh" (The LORD provides).<br /><br />Back to Francis&nbsp;and the white smoke...&nbsp; I love a line from Christopher Lowney's remarkable book, <em>Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company that Changed the World.</em> He tells the story of the Jesuits, the "Society of Jesus" (of which Francis is a member). And, he describes the Jesuit calling as "living with one foot raised". Not&nbsp;as Captain Morgan, but as the availability to go anywhere at any time for the mission of Jesus Christ.
