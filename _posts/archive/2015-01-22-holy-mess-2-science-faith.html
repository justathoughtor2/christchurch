And we went on to learn from John Wesley and the great odd couple of the Old Testament that it is possible for us to be united in heart, even when we are not of one mind. Today, we’ll be exploring some questions around the intersection of science and faith. In the coming weeks, we’ll address human life, human sexuality, church and state, and judgment. You will disagree with me, at least once, over this series of messages. I don’t have the “final answer” to end all discussion. In the church, we offer Jesus, not answers, not miracles. It is my hope that we move through these controversies and grow in love with Jesus and one another, despite all our differences. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">There are a number of intersecting points for science and faith, among them:</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><ul><li>The future of what it means to be human, particularly as we continue to learn how to “improve” ourselves cybernetically. Philosophers are already giving courses in “the post-human”. And particularly as we continue to discover the implications of the human genome, and the impact that has on the biblical phrase “the image of God”.</li><li>Appropriate limitations to human action on scientific knowledge. Should we inject growth hormone into livestock or genetically engineer food crops to be immune to herbicides? Should we do research on embryonic stem cells, or only adult stem cells? Should we develop artificial intelligence that could take over the world and enslave or destroy the human race? (It does make for great movies!)</li><li>The question of origins. Creation? Intelligent Design? Evolution?</li></ul><o:p></o:p><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">   </div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Of these three areas, we will take a little time to focus directly on the last matter, on origins. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal">First, however, let’s introduce the Scripture passages and consider them through the lens of science and faith. The first story comes from the book of Genesis and is a traditional story that answers the question: “Why do we speak <i>different</i> languages?” It is an important passage for understanding a theology of the city, but only when paired with biblical visions of the city of God. And, it is the first grand technological project of the human race. “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth” (Gn 11.4). As a project, it has two fatal flaws. First, its express purpose is in disobedience to God’s creation mandate to human beings to “fill the earth” and care for it. They do not want to fill the earth. They have no interest in discovery and exploration. They want to stay in one place. The second problem with this technology project is that it is all about pride: “Let us make a name for ourselves.” It was pride, after all, that led to the very first disobedience, the serpent selling the lie that “when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Gn 3.5). Just because we can build a tower to heaven does not mean we should. Just because we can eat the fruit and know good and evil does not mean we should. (I know more than enough about evil, personally!) Just because we can engineer a better human, clone, use growth hormones does not mean that we should. The Babel story warns us against the combination of human pride with technology and science. A little humility is called for.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second story, of the wise men from the East, is a story of scientists seeking Jesus. To our ears, as we read this story, it sounds a bit more like some exotic astrologers, the kind of folks that show up as the quirky, sometimes comedic characters in movies and stories. Think Whoopi Goldberg’s character in <i>Ghost,</i>or Professor Trelawny in the Harry Potter stories. When we don’t take them seriously, we miss out on the fact that they were at the leading edge of astronomy in their time, brilliant men who devoted their lives to science. And in their devotion to science, they met Jesus. We also forget that for a long time, astronomy and astrology were not as separate as they are today. Johannes Kepler, the great astronomer who pioneered the three laws of planetary motion, also wrote horoscopes – and supported his family by doing so.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">It is an unfortunate fact that, far too often in history, the church has declared war on science. There is, of course, irresponsible science (like Babel). For that matter, there is plenty of irresponsible religion (like the Crusades, the Inquisition, and human slavery). Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler upended the conventional scientific conclusion that the moon, sun, planets, and stars all orbited the earth as the center of the universe. They proposed, instead, that the earth orbited the sun. It was a monumental breakthrough, one more example of what Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, calls the “self-correcting” work of science (58). But the church, which exerted significant power in Europe, refused to embrace this change. The church had concluded that the vision of an earth-centered universe was exactly what the Scripture described. After all, the Bible speaks of “the rising of the sun”, which seems to put the earth at the center. The fact that this is patently a figure of speech meant nothing at the time, and these great scientists were branded as heretics, taking their lives into their hands and putting their families at risk. Kepler’s work and fame may have contributed to his mother being tried as a witch. She was released without conviction but died a year later.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alister McGrath, who began his career in molecular biophysics and now writes and teaches theology, who began his faith journey as an atheist and is now an Anglican priest, who embraces evolutionary theory and the biblical creation accounts, quotes St. Augustine, who pastored and wrote in the dying days of the Roman Empire. Augustine, in writing on Genesis, had some remarkable wisdom to share about science and faith. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">In matters that are so obscure and far beyond our vision, we find in Holy Scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such cases, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search for truth justly undermines our position, we too fall with it. (Also cited by Collins, 83)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Many years after Augustine, when Copernican theory was being argued, the church had forgotten his wisdom. Neither our faith nor the Scriptures are violated by this scientific breakthrough. But if we set up an either-or, we are in danger of falling. And, even worse, we set up a false and unnecessary barrier to faith. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This false barrier to faith is, personally, my greatest concern with and grief over how the church has dealt with the creation-evolution debate. Too many people who are outside the faith have concluded that it is not possible to follow Jesus and subscribe to the theory of evolution and that evolution disproves the Bible. The major reason they make that conclusion is that too many of us in the church have shared those same assumptions. Yes, evolutionary theory can support an entirely materialistic and atheistic worldview. And Christian faith is certainly in opposition to such a view of the world. However, evolutionary theory – just like the Copernican revolution before it – does not necessarily require someone to deny faith. Why should we tell scientists like Kepler and Charles Darwin, both of whom at one point were headed toward the priesthood, that they cannot be faithful disciples of Jesus and faithful scientists at the same time?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Almost 30 years ago, I was in my freshman year at Bible College. The science course was focused on creation science as a better explanation for origins than evolution. We spent time on some of the observed gaps in evolutionary theory – missing links in the fossil record, macro- versus micro-evolution, and all that evolution cannot explain about the development of the first life forms – the jump from solitary amino acids to single cell life forms is still a mystery. We looked at the improbability of spontaneous life and the improbability of a universe like ours randomly developing. We talked about the idea that God created human beings not as infants but as adults. They looked thirty years old, but weren’t a day over a day. So, couldn’t God make the earth with an apparent age? And, wouldn’t a universal flood have a similar geological impact as the Ice Age? At that time in my life, it all made sense. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we never heard the wisdom of Augustine. Simply pointing out the gaps in evolutionary theory does not hold up over time. We keep finding new missing links in the fossil record and the controversy over macro-evolution has disappeared with the results of genomic research. I only expect more and more of the gaps to be filled in over the years to come. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So, doesn’t evolutionary theory conflict directly with the biblical account? That depends, to a great degree, on how we read it the Bible. Augustine suggests that Scripture, particularly Genesis, contains passages that “can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith.” Jesus is the one who teaches that. In the context of one debate, Jesus responded to a question by asking, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” (Lk 10.26). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of how you read a text is by paying attention to what kind of text it is – a love letter, a poem, a news report, a word problem for math class. What kind of text is the creation account in Genesis 1? It is, in my opinion, not a science text. Therefore, I do not need to read it like a science text.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It tells us that God is our Creator and that we are made “in God’s image” – that we have something essential in common with each other and in common with God! It tells us that the pinnacle of hard work is not success but rest – “on the seventh day God rested” – and that the beginning of every day is with rest – “there was evening and there was morning, the first day”. It tells us that there is both darkness and light. It tells us that all God has made is GOOD – that our bodies are good! No, I do not believe that it is a science text. But, yes, it is most certainly TRUE.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may find yourself disagreeing with me, you may object to reading Genesis in this fashion. We are still brothers and sisters, we can still be of one heart. My hope is that we do not reject today’s “wise men from the East”, that we do not erect barriers to keep them from finding Jesus through science. Alister McGrath began as an atheist and now teaches theology as an Anglican priest, making almost the reverse journey with which Charles Darwin struggled. (Darwin made statements that described himself, alternatively, as an agnostic and as a believer in God, if not in Christian faith (Collins, 99), but he lacked in his era models for embracing both evolutionary theory and Christian faith.) Francis Collins, director of the Human Genome Project, began as an atheist, is now a committed follower of Jesus, and speaks of evolution as “settled science” along with gravity and relativity. Please feel free to disagree with them and others like them. And please do not prevent anyone from finding Jesus.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Francis Collins tells his personal story and reflects on evolutionary science and faith in the wonderful book <i>The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief.</i> In the book, he also quotes from other scientists as they address or approach questions of faith from the starting point of evolutionary theory. To my knowledge, and unlike McGrath and Collins, none of these three claim to follow Jesus. But they all directly address questions of faith from their perspective as evolutionary scientists:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Stephen Hawking, whose personal story is now being told in the movie <i>Theory of Everything</i>, and who speaks of himself as an atheist, nevertheless writes in his book <i>A Brief History of Time:</i><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us (cited in Collins, 75).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Charles Darwin, in his conclusion of <i>The Origin of Species,</i> writes:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved (cited by Collins, 98-99).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Astrophysicist and agnostic Robert Jastrow comments, in <i>God and the Astronomers,</i> about the “limits of science” to get to the initial moments of the Big Bang (Collins, 66). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">At this moment it seems as though science will never be able to raise the curtain on the mystery of creation. For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries (cited in Collins, 66).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">May today’s scientists reject the pride of Babel and follow the star, or the Big Bang, or quantum mechanics, or human evolution, and find Jesus. For that matter, may today’s disciples of Jesus, may I, reject pride and devote ourselves to the humble worship of our Lord. “O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth” (Ps 8.1).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>On your note sheet, I have a few assignments for you to consider:<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">Pray for us as we have these conversations, to honor our differences and to stay focused on being united in the love of God.
