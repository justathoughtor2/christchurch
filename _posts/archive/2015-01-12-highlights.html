From my Scripture reading application in 2014. <a href="https://www.youversion.com/">Check out the YouVersion app!</a><br /><br /><b>Ecclesiastes 5.9</b> – But this is a gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.<br /><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>A sign of quality leadership is paying attention to little things, to things that might be considered "beneath" you, to things that affect the daily experience of people you lead.</o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Psalm 119.96</b> – I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commandment is exceedingly broad.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">There is no limit to the perfection of the Word of God! Read it and weep .,, with joy!&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br /></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Isaiah 28.20</b> – For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">I just loved the imagery for judgment in this passage - not one of destruction but one of persistent discomfort. Interesting.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Zechariah 13.6</b> – And if one asks him, ‘What are these wounds on your back?’ he will say, ‘The wounds I received in the house of my friends.’<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the context, this is about false prophets, who often practiced flogging themselves, attempting to hide their practice. It also sounds exactly like the kinds of stories we fabricate to protect those who abuse us.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div>
