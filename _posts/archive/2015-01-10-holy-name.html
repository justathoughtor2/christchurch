And the only coercion is the coercion of his love and his humility, his willingness to embrace human weakness and pain, to embrace my weakness and pain.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, calling Jesus “Lord” ends in martyrdom. That is, statistically, rare. But for all of his disciples, Jesus invites us to “take up your cross daily and follow”. Again, we are only following the Lord who takes up his own cross and helps us to carry ours. Every small act of obedience, every choice to submit our will, every choice to deny our pride, every choice to make ourselves vulnerable, every choice to be faithful when it is hard to be faithful … That’s our daily cross. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Calling Jesus “Lord” means our obedience and submission. It also means our witness. It means that we speak up, that we claim our faith in public – unlike my children in their adolescent embarrassment. In the first century, witness and martyrdom went together. The Greek word for witness, <i>martus,</i>is actually the root for our English word martyr. As Jesus said, “Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels” (Mark 8.38).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Today we share in John Wesley’s New Year tradition of the Covenant Prayer. It is a prayer which emphasizes what it means for us to call Jesus “Lord”. Please take the prayer service home with you and refer to it throughout the year in your personal prayer life.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Blessing:</b> Numbers 6:24-26 (Placing the name of the LORD on Israel)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">The LORD bless you and keep you; <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">the LORD make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you;<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">the LORD lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.<o:p></o:p></div>
