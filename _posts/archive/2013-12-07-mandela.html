A message from our Bishop:<br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><strong><em><span style="font-family: inherit;">"All this is from  God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of  reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ....And  he has committed to us the message of reconciliation." </span></em></strong><br /><strong><em><span style="font-family: inherit;">(2 Corinthians  5:18-19, NIV)</span></em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Do not be overcome  by evil, but overcome evil with good."</span></em></strong><br /><strong><em><span style="font-family: inherit;">(Romans  12:21)</span></em></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Dear United Methodists of  the Susquehanna Conference:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Greetings to you in the  name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, Prince of Peace, Healer of our  brokenness, and Hope of the world!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">The news finally came.  President Nelson Mandela passed away. The world is mourning the death of "the  most favorite son of South Africa."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">I have some personal memory  of him. In 2006, when the Council of Bishops had its first meeting outside the  United States in Maputo, capital city of Mozambique, we received a surprising  gift; he and his wife Gra√ßa Machel  visited with us. It was an awesome moment of privilege to be in his presence.  After the Council meeting, Lisa and I had the opportunity to visit the house  where he once lived in Johannesburg and the prison cell where he was a captive  for 27 years in Robben Island. Our appreciation for what he was to the world, as  well as to his people of South Africa, continued to expand after these  experiences.</span><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">There is no one quite like  Nelson Mandela. There is not another political figure who drew such respect and  affection all over the world as he did. He was a role model in the highest  esteem in the political world; as Mother Teresa was in the religious world. The  way he influenced and inspired people of all walks of life from the most  oppressed, to the ordinary, to the most powerful across all races throughout the  world was almost unprecedented. Indeed he was one of the most admired persons of  the modern world. For many he was the one.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Across the continents,  Nelson Mandela was the icon of a better world. Indeed his legacy is about the  vision of an alternative world in peace and justice. He personified the hope for  healing and reconciliation among the oppressed and the oppressors by embodying  the mandate of the Christian faith at its core; choice of love over hatred,  forgiveness over vengeance, and reconciliation over resentment. It is the most  challenging choice for any one of us, including Nelson Mandela. He struggled  with it. He is remembered as saying that "I am not a saint unless a saint is a  sinner who is always trying." He is also remembered as saying that he chose to  forgive so that he would not stay imprisoned by hatred. He exemplified what we  can be by evoking the best of humanity in us. His courage to do the right thing  by paying the price of self-sacrifice will continue to inspire the citizens of  the world.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Nelson Mandela convinced us  that the vision of a transformed world is alive in the world today and is  achievable. Individuals and nations can change for the better. He demonstrated  the truth of it in the world arena. But he also made it very clear that it has  to be demonstrated in the personal arena. As we celebrate and honor with  thanksgiving the invaluable memory of what Nelson Mandela meant to the world, it  is my prayer that the hope for a better world in peace, justice, and  reconciliation is rekindled. And the prayer shall include, "beginning with  me."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">May the Spirit of Advent  abound all around you, your loved ones, and our world.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">In Christ,</span><br /><br />                         <br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Jeremiah Park</span>
