I am reminded of God calling Abram (a.k.a. Abraham): "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you" (Genesis 12.1).&nbsp; He leaves behind so much, so much that is familiar and good, in order to be obedient in pursuing God.&nbsp; And, in the process, he is blessed and becomes a blessing to others in ways he could not have anticipated.&nbsp; That's my prayer for our family, for our churches and communities.<br /><br />I am reminded of Jesus' instruction to the disciples when they collect the donkey for the ride into Jerusalem.&nbsp; When asked, "What are you doing, taking my donkey!" -- and I assume it was not a polite question -- they were to reply, "The Lord needs it."&nbsp; Our part is to say "yes", pack our bags, and step out on a new adventure.&nbsp; God goes before us to prepare the way.&nbsp; Please join us in prayer.&nbsp; (And help pack, or unpack, depending on which end of this adventure we meet you!)<br /><br />The <a href="http://bethanyumcyork.blogspot.com/2013/03/bohanans-on-move.html">announcement of our pending move</a>, shared at Bethany Church on Sunday March 17<br />The <a href="http://bethanyumcyork.blogspot.com/2013/03/our-new-pastor.html">announcement of Bethany's new pastor</a>, shared at Bethany Church on Sunday March 24
