<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">By our district superintendent, Rev. Dr. Tom Salsgiver</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over and over as we listened and learned about the Korean Methodist Churches and people, we learned that they are a generous people.&nbsp; This is exhibited in their stewardship of time and financial resources.&nbsp; (Next week I’ll talk a bit about their generosity in giving time.)</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We heard several times that the understanding of Korean Methodists is that they are to be giving generously of their financial resources for the work of Christ.&nbsp; The Bupyeong Church is in a rather poor neighborhood.&nbsp; The pastor told us that most of the church members are not rich—but they have a generous spirit and a generous heart.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the expectations of being a Korean Methodist Christian is that you will tithe as a minimum example of your commitment to God and Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They unashamedly talk about giving.&nbsp; Their reason for giving, they said, was that they have freely received God’s grace and the gift of eternal life—so they must give freely of their possessions.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the people were building the first part of the church building, the cost was $10,000,000. Here are three examples of how they gave:</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-left: 1.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">1.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 7.0pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">When the Bupyeong Church was building their first church, one man had pledged to give $20,000.&nbsp; He had a dream that Jesus told him , “I gave my blood for you—how much will you give back to me.”&nbsp; In the dream Jesus told the man to give $20,000.&nbsp; The man woke up and when the bank opened, he withdrew $20,000 and gave it to the church.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-left: 1.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">2.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 7.0pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Over and over to build the church, people would sell their homes, move into a smaller home and give the money to the church.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-left: 1.25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">3.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 7.0pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">People who were getting married were so committed to the building of the church and Christ’s kingdom they gave the money they had saved for their wedding to the church and had a very simple wedding.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The church was paid off in 1 year!</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">To celebrate the 74<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Bupyeong Church, the congregation felt a call to start a new church.&nbsp; They prayed and prayed until they were certain it was God’s will.&nbsp; Once they believed it was God’s will, this church went out and purchased land in another community where it is projected to have 30,000 new people move into that community.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Once the land was bought, the church paid to build the church and to purchase all the equipment and furnishing for the church.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of the church was $3.4 million with furnishings costing $130,000.&nbsp; The new church start began September 22, 2014 and is debt free.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The church had a vision that God wanted them to start new churches and ministries in Indonesia. The pastor gave a call that it would cost $30,000 to start one church and they had a vision to start 10.&nbsp; In 2 months the church had given enough extra money that they started 10 new churches in Indonesia.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Some of their parishioners were so concerned about getting children to Sunday school that families bought vans so they could transport their neighborhood children to Sunday school.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">This church also wanted to contribute more to the life of their community.&nbsp; They request a list of people from the town who cannot pay their electric and water bill.&nbsp; They send $5,000-$10,000 each week to help persons pay their bills.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The pastor listed several other missions they do in the community and in the city.&nbsp; But I think the examples I have given you, are enough that you can see that the churches we visited are filled with generous Christians.</span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">During one of the sermons in the early Morning Prayer service, the pastor reminded people that they do not have bazaars or fund raisers in the church.&nbsp; He said while they are fun and there is a spirit of community, the church is to be generous in their offerings and their financial resources.&nbsp; Thus their entire budget and mission outreach is done through the generosity of the members giving sacrificially—not fundraisers.&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Why do they give so much and so generously.&nbsp; They take seriously the fact that Jesus Christ sacrificed his life for their salvation and the salvation of the world.&nbsp; They can do no less than sacrifice for His mission and ministry.&nbsp; The pastor said, “we have freely received God’s grace—we must give as generously as God has given to us.</span><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">God is blessing these churches and doing great things in the lives of the unchurched.&nbsp; Could it be that the blessings come as the people in the church give more of themselves to make sure that mission and ministry happen?</span><o:p></o:p></div>
