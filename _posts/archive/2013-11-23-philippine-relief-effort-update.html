UMCOR had reached $982,000.00 in online giving for  Philippine relief. Money is beginning to flow from local church offerings and  that money is not included in the online figure. In addition, a large donation  has been given from the Germany Central Conference.</span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"></span><div style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;"></span><div style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span>UMCOM  is helping with communications in the Philippines, including setting up local  emergency radio stations which will direct people to  resources.&nbsp;</span><span>December 3</span><span>&nbsp;has been set as United Methodist  Giving Day during which gifts will be matched up to one half million  dollars.</span>&nbsp;</span></div><span style="font-size: small;"></span><div style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></div><span style="font-size: small;"></span><div style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Rev.
