<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Bf02dLrJCR8" width="420"></iframe><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br />2014/03/29 Christ Church, Mountain Top<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Prayer, Psalm 130<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Children, John 9<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Message, Luke 15.1-6, 25-32<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We’ve been using the resources of Tim Keller’s book and video <i>The Prodigal God</i>and looking at the story traditionally known as the “Parable of the Prodigal Son” and we have emphasized that it is a story about two sons, one is “very very bad” and the other is “very very good”.&nbsp; Most of the time when we look at the story, we fixate on the sinful younger brother and his welcome home in repentance.&nbsp; But we forget about the “very very good” big brother, furious with the father for welcoming the younger brother home.&nbsp; Last week we made the point that he is lost – outside the salvation feast – because his goodness, his righteousness, is a barrier to the father’s grace.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, we said that if we look only at the younger brother, we ignore a major character in the story AND we ignore the cost involved in bringing the younger brother back into the family.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Today, we start off with that cost.&nbsp; When the younger brother comes home, he prepares one of those rehearsed speeches of repentance.&nbsp; His planned speech: “Father, I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&nbsp; Let me be like one of your hired hands.” &nbsp;That is, let me earn my way back, let me prove my worth, let me foot the bill, let me make restitution.&nbsp; But, the father cuts him off mid-speech, denying him even the opportunity to offer restitution.&nbsp; He declares, “Quick!&nbsp; Bring the best robe and put it on him.&nbsp; Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.”&nbsp; (The ring was equivalent to an ancient signature, conferring legal access to the family inheritance.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does it all cost?&nbsp; It cost the younger son nothing.&nbsp; And if all we look at in the story is the interaction between the younger son and the father, we’d assume the father foots the bill himself.&nbsp; After all, he seems to be the man in charge.&nbsp; But that’s why we must not miss what happens with the older brother, whom the father reminds, “Everything I have is yours”.&nbsp; In the ancient Palestinian tradition, if the father divided the estate before he died, he still retained the rights to use it and profit from it, even though the son held the title.&nbsp; So, whose money was dear old dad giving away?&nbsp; Whose robe?&nbsp; Whose checking account?&nbsp; Big brother’s.&nbsp; Big brother is paying the bill.&nbsp; It cost him a lot to bring his younger brother back into the family, and he wants nothing of it.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So, note this: Forgiveness is free – to the younger son, but it is very expensive – to the older brother.&nbsp; Grace is free – to the younger son, but it is very costly – to the older brother.&nbsp; In recent years we’ve been reminded that “freedom isn’t free”.&nbsp; We know what that means: Freedom is free for most of us, but it is not something to be trivialized because it has been paid for, generation after generation, with the greatest of sacrifice.&nbsp; In the same way, and even more so, the grace of God is free, but not trivial, not to be presumed upon, not to be cheapened by ignoring the cost that was paid.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">But back to the older brother in the story.&nbsp; He had no interest in bearing this expense.&nbsp; He wanted nothing to do with the younger brother.&nbsp; He had no desire to be reunited with him at the feast.&nbsp; One of the questions we discussed in our small groups was, “How would the attitude of the elder brother make it harder for the younger brother to come home?” (Keller, study guide).&nbsp; It is this kind of question that points out the power to this story.&nbsp; Because there is pain in every family story.&nbsp; Will we reconcile or remain apart?&nbsp; Can the “older brother” of the family get beyond himself to truly love, to reunite?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Biblical story begins with the original couple and their first two sons, brothers.&nbsp; The older brother, Cain, is jealous of his younger brother, Abel.&nbsp; God comes to him, but Cain does not listen.&nbsp; After Cain kills Abel, the LORD confronts him and Cain responds, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”&nbsp; The answer, of course, is “Yes”.&nbsp; But Cain, like the elder brother in the story, was more focused on his anger than on being family.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Ron when he was an older man.&nbsp; He shared a story of his family dynamics from younger days.&nbsp; A brother, was the “lost sheep” of the family.&nbsp; He lived on and off the streets, disconnected from the rest of the family, in a town an hour away.&nbsp; None of the other siblings wanted anything to do with him.&nbsp; But, when their father was in his final illness, he asked Ron, the elder brother, to find his younger brother and bring him home for a final reunion.&nbsp; It took Ron several days, but he found his brother and persuaded him to come home and see Dad one more time.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is pain in every family story.&nbsp; Will we reconcile or remain apart?&nbsp; Can the “older brother” of the family get beyond himself to truly love, to reunite?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Remember the first two stories Jesus tells?&nbsp; The lost sheep is sought by a shepherd, the lost coin is sought by a woman.&nbsp; In each story, someone goes out to seek and save the lost.&nbsp; But not in this story.&nbsp; Yes, the father does run to greet the son when he sees him coming from far off, but no one goes out into the far country to seek him.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as Jesus tells this third story, the story of the lost sons, folks notice the missing seeker and they know who should be seeking – the older brother.&nbsp; His role is to maintain and protect the family honor, to function as the <i>goel</i>, the <i>redeemer,</i> in the Jewish family system.&nbsp; One of the most important roles of the <i>goel, </i>the eldest brother, is to buy back family members (like his younger brother) from slavery.&nbsp; (Bruce Malina, <i>Windows on the World of Jesus: Time Travel to Ancient Judea,</i> Window 2, “Father, Son, and Daughter”, 1993, Westminster/John Knox Press.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this story, we have a “very very good” older brother, but one who shows no concern for the heart of the father, for the family honor, for the redemption of his brother.&nbsp; He makes us long for a true older brother, one who is willing, in the words of Tim Keller, to “seek us and bring us back at any risk and any cost to himself” (notes for pastors).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The younger brother in the story has a self-righteous, superior older brother who does not seek and save.&nbsp; We have Jesus, who describes himself as one who “came to seek out and to save the lost” (Luke 19.10).&nbsp; (See also Joseph Fitzmyer, <i>The Gospel According to Luke X-XXIV,</i> p 1086, Doubleday 1985.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our “true elder brother” makes all of us family: Hebrews 2.11, “Both the one who makes [us] holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers [and sisters].”&nbsp; And, Romans 8.29, “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he [Jesus] might be the firstborn among many brothers [and sisters].”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">One of the earliest hymns of the church is recorded for us in Philippians 2.&nbsp; The lyrics read, in part, <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though he was in the form of God, <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he did not regard equality with God <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as something to be exploited,<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but emptied himself,<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taking the form of a slave,<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being born in human likeness.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And being found in human form,<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he humbled himself<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and became obedient to the point of death – <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even death on a cross. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippians 2.6-8 <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">“Everything I have is yours,” the father says to the older son.&nbsp; And, Jesus doesn’t grasp for it, doesn’t treasure it, doesn’t hoard it.&nbsp; He empties himself, he goes looking for us in the far country, he finds us and brings us back from our slavery.&nbsp; “For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8.9).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I love the lines in the ancient hymn, attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What thou, my Lord, has suffered<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was all for sinners’ gain:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine, mine was the transgression,<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thine the deadly pain.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo, here I fall, my Savior!<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Tis I deserve thy place;<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look on my with thy favor,<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vouchsafe to me thy grace.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “O Sacred Head Now Wounded”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">So, note this: Forgiveness is free – to the younger son, but it is very expensive – to the older brother.&nbsp; Grace is free – to the younger son, but it is very costly – to the older brother.&nbsp; And our older brother pays the price with joy.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is there for us to do?&nbsp; It is free, after all.&nbsp; Worship.&nbsp; Bind ourselves in love to this brother who seeks and finds us.&nbsp; And, as Columbo says, “One more thing.”&nbsp; Jesus emptied himself to make room for us in the house of God.&nbsp; “I go to prepare a place for you,” he tells his disciples as he prepares for his death (John 14.1-6).&nbsp; We are called to share in his mission, to empty ourselves to make room for others in the family.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Timothy Keller, <i>Prodigal God</i> and notes for pastors<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Joseph Fitzmyer, <i>The Gospel According to Luke X-XXIV,</i> p 1086, Doubleday 1985<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Bruce Malina, <i>Windows on the World of Jesus: Time Travel to Ancient Judea,</i>Window 2, “Father, Son, and Daughter”, 1993, Westminster/John Knox Press<o:p></o:p></div>
