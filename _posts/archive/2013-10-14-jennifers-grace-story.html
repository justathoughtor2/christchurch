The text of her remarks is below.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> <span style="line-height: 115%;">A few weeks ago, when Pastor JP spoke about grace for the first time, he asked the congregation about when our personal moment was that we accepted Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I sat in the pew and I asked myself the same question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have to say that needed to think about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Before I go any further, I have to let you know that I’ve grown up in the United Methodist Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I grew up going to Mt. Pocono United Methodist Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I participated in all the activities: cherub and youth choir, youth group, bell choir, summer music camps, Sunday school from a toddler to senior in high school and was confirmed in the faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So, I did it all and I feel I learned a lot in the process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>However, I don’t think I knew everything was truly real until 11 years ago when my father passed away.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span><a name='more'></a><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;">My father had his share of medical issues, and ultimately he died from having blood on the brain due to a stroke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He was not a candidate for any type of medical intervention; the doctors did not think he would survive any additional procedures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And since he had a living will, we (my family &amp; I) waited for nature to take its course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For 3 days we sat by his bedside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My mother, brother and 3 sisters were there every day.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;">The night before my father died we thought he was going to pass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So one by one, we went to his bedside to say goodbye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was not married then, so I asked my mother to go with me into my father’s room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t know what to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And I remembered that my mother taught me that when I didn’t know what to say or needed help, I should say the Lord’s Prayer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She always said it covered everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So together we said it, by his side.</span></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">My father lived for another day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And that night we were all in his room, telling stories about Dad, things he would say, family vacations, and laughing a lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think for a moment, we forgot how grave he was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then with no warning, my father opened his eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He did not speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My mother moved to the opposite side of the bed where he was looking at the window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She said to him, “George, it is ok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can go.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And with that, his eyes closed and he died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Standing at the foot of the bed, I could see the life leave his body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was as if his spirit in a glow left him and I could see it go, from his head down to his feet. I remember saying out loud, “Did you see that?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t remember if anyone said anything in response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But I felt at that moment, I saw a miracle</span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/null" name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">. It was a privilege to be there and see the life leave his body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At that moment, I knew everything I had been taught was true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t believe just on faith anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I now know that it is all true.</span></span>
