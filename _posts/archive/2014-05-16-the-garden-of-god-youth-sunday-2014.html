<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZyqopvLl-34" width="420"></iframe><br />Youth Sunday (and Mother's Day) 2014 - Nikki and Grace share the message.<br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Introduction-</span><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Amen and amen. First off I would just like to wish everyone a happy Mother's Day, whether you are a mother, a mother to be , or are honoring a mother figure in your life. Today we all have something to celebrate, memories to commemorate, and someone to honor and cherish. Like little seeds being planted into the ground we all need nurture to grow. Such as, love, advice, teachings, and wisdom. Without these we wouldn’t be able to stand on our own.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now today we read Romans 12:9-13. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">1) and in Romans, Paul tells us to: <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">(Romans 12:9-13)<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Let love be genuine <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1.5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Hate what is evil,<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1.5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Hold fast to what is good;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">However I for one can attest to the difficulty of embracing this ideal. At times it can be so confusing to know what is good and what is bad. Not everything is black and white, or cut and dry. Sometimes we stray from the right path. While some of the decisions &nbsp;we make may still go awry, they should not slow us down. There is this one phrase that all of the ten commandments fall under, love God and love everyone. This may be hard to do at sometimes, but if we do get off the path we can always learn from it. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">He also tells us to: <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">love one another with mutual affection;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (and to)<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Outdo one another in showing honor.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I can remember when I was younger, my father used to take me and my brother out to the park to play soccer. We both had joined a team and we wanted to impress him with our soccer abilities. Both of us wanted to be the best in his eyes, and so we would push ourselves to new limits to make him proud. Every time my brother demonstrated a new skill, i would counter with another. We became each others friendly competition and began to improve alongside each other. By going up against each, and learning from each other, we began to become better players. In the same way Paul wants us to continue to outdo one another in demonstrating christian values. Not necessarily to be the “best” or to compete with each other, like my brother and i, but to improve and grow from each other. He wants us to make better disciples of ourselves by learning from others examples and striving to outdo ourselves. In the same way I and my brother wanted to make our father proud, he wants us to want to desire to make god proud. &nbsp;Paul also says, <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span></div><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do not lag in zeal,<o:p></o:p></span><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Be ardent in spirit, <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Persevere in prayer.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">(and to)<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Contribute to the needs of the needs of saint;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Although at times it may be difficult we should stay firm in the faith. We can do this by preserving it in prayer, and by exercising its values in everyday life. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Paul also says that we should, <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“Extend hospitality to strangers.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This line really hits home for me and has especially affected my life. As some of you may know, I am adopted, and originally from China. A stranger found me and placed me into an orphanage. Papers were sent out &nbsp;about me by the orphanage, and that's when my current parents learned about me, and fell in love. 15 years ago they traveled to china, and now here I am. I have two amazing sisters, a loveable mom and dad, and fantastic grandmas. I am very fortunate to be here, and to be well loved and nurtured by my family. To me my parents are like precious jewels that help me grow. I have learned so much from them,others, and also God. I have learned not only how to be a better Christian , but also how to prosper as a disciple. My family and god love me unconditionally and they always help me learn from my mistakes. I know God has been watching over me my whole life. Words cannot express how blessed I am. While not everyone may have a mother, everyone has a mother figure they can learn from.Each day is a new learning day.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In addition to Romans, we also heard a few verses from Proverbs. (Proverbs 31:10b 25-30)<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now, in Proverbs Solomon writes,<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“She is far more precious than jewels.” <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This sentence is meant as a heading or Solomon’s main assertion, in which he spends the rest of his writings explaining. In the rest of his writings he attempts to prove his assertion and answer for us why she is far more precious than jewels. By explaining to us why she is, he creates for us a model of a better disciple. A model that he hopes &nbsp;will guide us into becoming better disciples. He states <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Strength and dignity are her clothing, <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And she laughs at the time to come.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">These are the first virtues of a better disciple that he mentions. Clothes are what you show people. They tell what kind of personality you have. Strength and dignity is what she provides as her personality to show people that she is strong and confident.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">She opens her mouth with wisdom,<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And the teachings of kindness is on her tongue.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">She looks well to the ways of her household,<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And does not eat the bread of idleness.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">By this Paul means that a better disciple acts in the ways of the lord. And how a better disciple will act, speak, and carry themself, with christian ideals in their heart. He also says that they will look out for ways to act through god and maintain the ways of a christian in their household. He also says a better disciple will spread the word of god to their children and to other people of god. All while ignoring the drama and temptations to stray away from the ways of the lord. &nbsp;Next he says:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Her children rise up and call her happy; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Her husband too, and he praises her:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1.5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Many women have done excellently,<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1.5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">But you surpass them all."<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">He also means by this that all of these people lift up this person who makes everyone around them happy. Not just thinking of themselves, but others also. They are happy making other people happy and many people can do this, but this particular person makes a special effort.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">charm is deceitful,<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">and beauty is vain,<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 1.5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">But a woman who honors the LORD is to be praised. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Paul is explaining to us that while we may believe that material things or personal images might be important. That a person who rejects the temptations and relinquishes such focus, for the lord is to be honored. There are more important things in life than that new phone, or tv. We need to look at the big picture.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">3)big picture <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now how does this relate to the garden of god? Think of yourself as a seed, what does a seed need to grow and develop? Water, sunlight, food, the nurturing care from skilled hand. Well God is like all those things. He can help us prosper into better disciples. This can also be eluded to a mother figure trying to help us through our whole life.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Everyone has their own garden. A garden that needs to go through certain steps to flourish. When planning to plant a garden one must use the proper tools, and make a conscious decision to plant a garden. Accordingly we must decide what to plant in it. We must make a conscious decision both to plant this garden and what is worthy of planting in it. Both Paul and Solomon give us inspiration and ideas of what to plant in their writings. The fruits of the spirit give us inspiration of what to plant in it. But ultimately we must choose to plant the values of a better disciple in our garden. And we must actively remove weeds and any other unwanted materials from our garden, that have the potential to be toxic to it. After we have decided to plant our Garden, we then must remove rocks in our way and prepare the soil. We must give ourselves the tools to have a successful garden. To do this we need to resolve obstacles that act as rocks in our garden, and add the words of god as fertilizer into our garden. Outside forces will work against our garden, attempt us to distract us from it, tempt us to do things that could harm it, or neglect it. But we must stay strong, ignore their idleness, and continue to cultivate our Garden. We have no control over these outside forces, we cannot control how much sunlight our garden will get, or what the weather will be like. We do however have the ability to control how strong our garden is. We must make it strong enough to overcome all of these impediments, and uncertainties. We must give our garden the defenses to weather the storm. However we will not be alone in this task. God will guide us, and help us. He will protect our garden even if we slip up. He will watch over it even when we arent. And he will continue to work on it when outside forces do not permit us to. He will be the water that saves our garden from a drought, and the sunlight that saves us in an endless winter. God is the ultimate farmer and he will protect us from what life and outside forces throw at us. All he asks of us is that we put in the time and effort. It won’t always be easy, and it will be a labor of love. But if we work hard and are dedicated we will see the benefits. We will see how god is changing us. God is giving us the potential to grow and mature into better disciples. All we have to do is be willing to let him guide us. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the same way mothers, help us, and Guide us. As we are born we are the seeds being planted. As we grow and prosper, we are guided by wisdom, experiences, advice, and love. Those are like the water, fertilizer, air, and sunlight to our seeds. God and our mothers help us. Without someone, a stranger, looking out for me, I would not be standing here today. Everyone has a mother or a mother figure that helps them grow and learn as time goes on. God is looking out for everyone always. He is always helping us to become a better person that we are potentially to be and also become into a better disciple. Our mother figures and god nurture us always as we continue to grow. They love and care for us through the rough times and help us follow the right path in our darkest times and help us shine too. In the name of the Lord I invite all of you to grow your own garden. Amen.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp;</span></div>
