(Not that our military does not teach its leaders to question. That is why “obeying orders” is no defense for doing wrong.) Part of the process of basic training is to tear down the façade of our individual rights, our life of privilege, and teach us to obey. That’s never a pretty or comfortable process. As a Vietnam era Marine drill instructor told me: “We had only a few weeks to prepare an 18 year old kid to fight, and we had to do whatever it took to keep him alive.”<br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I would like to give you that gift today, that messy and uncomfortable gift: To tear down that façade of privilege, rights, and self-sufficiency. </div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to, but I can’t give you that gift. It is God’s to give. And, there is a degree to which you must choose it, must accept it, must welcome it. Only you can sign away your life and your independence to Jesus. Like a fresh-faced recruit, who may not really know what she got herself in to, or what Uncle Sam got her in to, we don’t know what we’ll get in to. We just know that we have given up any claim to ourselves and our lives. We have submitted totally to the authority of another – to Jesus our Lord.</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith” (Mt 8.10)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Listen to how this career officer describes faith: "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and the slave does it" (8.8-9).</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">For the officer, faith is exercised by trusting the authority of Jesus enough to obey him. He offers Jesus his total obedience, making no deals, giving no conditions in advance, providing no limitation to Jesus’ authority over him. “Such faith.”</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just say the word … and my servant will be healed.” He was not only putting illness under the authority of Jesus. He was putting himself under the authority of Jesus. He was giving up the personal claim to his rights, his privileges, his self-sufficiency, to trust Jesus and Jesus’ will for him.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I would like to give you that gift today, that messy and uncomfortable gift: To tear down that façade of privilege, rights, and self-sufficiency. </div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I want the best for each of us, I want the best for me. And, the best for me is not found in enlarged privilege, in articulated rights, in self-sufficiency. The best for me is found in surrender. It is those who depend on their privilege, those whom Jesus called “heirs of the kingdom”, who find themselves in the “outer darkness”. I’d much rather be an outsider, from the “east and west”, who gets to eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, than an insider who finds himself on the outside, in the dark.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I would like to give you that gift today, that messy and uncomfortable gift: To tear down that façade of privilege, rights, and self-sufficiency. </div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In America, we routinely stamp it “Return to Sender”. Men, particularly, struggle with this. We don’t want to ask for directions; do you think we want someone – even someone as good as Jesus – to be telling us what to do? All the time? Young people struggle with this. No, sir, we don’t get a vote. No, sir, we don’t age out at 18 and get to do whatever we want.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Enter the career officer, the military man with his distinctive haircut, squared shoulders, and upright posture. “I am a man under authority.” I choose a life of obedience to Jesus. “Such faith.” MegaFaith.</div>
