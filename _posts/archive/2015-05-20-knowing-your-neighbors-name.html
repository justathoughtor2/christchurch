I listened but then began to question the legitimacy of those observations—even if they had been made in jest. Of the ten or so gathered, probably two had grown up in the area. I found that “from here” didn’t actually mean “born and bred” here but more so “lived here more than ten years.” These comments explained how the prevailing culture had influenced the habits of many folks who moved here. But what was even more interesting was the fact that most people agreed about the concept of the statement that was made: most people don’t talk to anybody they don’t know, let alone gets to know their names.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><a href="http://freshexpressionsus.org/2015/03/23/do-you-think-its-worth-knowing-your-neighbors-name/?utm_source=Fresh+Expressions+Email+List&amp;utm_campaign=8b0fada3c1-March_ENews3_4_2015&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_eb9d1fd14e-8b0fada3c1-341869497">Read the whole article.</a></span>
