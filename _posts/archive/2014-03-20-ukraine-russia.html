Bishop Eduard Khegay, serving the Eurasia Episcopal Area (including Russia and the Ukraine), writes the following after meeting with leaders of The United Methodist Church in Kiev, Ukraine:<br /><br /><span style="line-height: 21px; text-indent: 30px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">My prayer is for Ukraine, for peace and unity. During our meeting of pastors and leaders of United Methodist Church in Ukraine this week we lifted up our prayers for the people and the country, for peace and unity. Brothers and sisters shared their worries and concerns for the country’s future. Many could not come from the east to Zakarpatie where we have had our meeting. As I was preaching in our churches in Zakarpatie, my heart was filled with grace and faith, when brothers and sisters with tears in their eyes lifted up their prayers to God for their country. In this politically conflicting time, the church continues to share the gospel way – the way of active ministry to people, preaching of hope and faith, proclamation of God’s power and providence in the history of humankind. According to testimonies of brothers and sisters from different cities, Christian churches never prayed so fervently for their country and for their people as in this difficult time. Also, people were never so open for the gospel and for prayer as in this time. I thank God for United Methodist churches in Ukraine, who bring hope and reconciliation to people in this difficult time, encourage people and serve those in need. Let us all stand in prayer for our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, for all people and country. My prayer is for Ukraine.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 21px; text-indent: 30px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><span style="line-height: 21px; text-indent: 30px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Check out the <a href="http://www.umc-eurasia.ru/en/my-prayer-ukraine">website of the Eurasia church</a>.</span></span>
