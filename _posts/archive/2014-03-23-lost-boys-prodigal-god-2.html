<div class="MsoNormal">2014/03/16 Christ Church, Mountain Top<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Prayer, Psalm 27<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Children, John 3.1-17<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Message, Luke 15.11-32<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Last week, we began our investigation of the story we know as “The Parable of the Prodigal Son” by examining the audience to the story and the two stories that immediately precede it.&nbsp; This week, we’ll investigate the first act in the story, the interaction between the younger son and the father.&nbsp; I encourage you to go deeper – reading the book, <i>The Prodigal God,</i> by Timothy Keller, whose resources contribute to this message series, and being part of one of our small groups.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I title this message “Lost Boys” because the story is about two sons, not one, and both are lost.&nbsp; I also use this title to allude to the J. M. Barrie play and novel <i>Peter Pan</i>.&nbsp; Pan and his lost boys, who never grow up, who refuse to deal with time, do battle with Captain Hook, who is obsessed with status and, in his own unique way, running away from time, banishing all clocks and watches from his presence.&nbsp; Their behavior is different, they are sworn enemies, but they share the same life-defining issue: time.&nbsp; In Jesus’ story here in Luke 15, the father has two boys.&nbsp; Their behavior is different, their lifestyle choices are miles apart, but they share the same issue: the father’s wealth.&nbsp; And both are lost.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the prophet Isaiah, we find descriptions of both forms of lostness (Isaiah 57:10-13).&nbsp; The lostness of the younger son:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">You grew weary from your many wanderings, but you did not say, "It is useless." You found your desire rekindled, and so you did not weaken.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Our desires lead us on “many wanderings” ... exactly where the “pursuit of happiness” can take us.&nbsp; We’ll only find ourselves at home when we are found by God.&nbsp; The lostness of the older son:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">I will concede your righteousness and your works, but they will not help you.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">How are righteousness and idols connected?&nbsp; In a self-sufficient spirituality, a spirituality in which we “earn” our way, we are our own Savior, we are our own idol.&nbsp; But an invitation to the kingdom feast is a gift, not a reward.&nbsp; And you are born into God’s family by a work of the Spirit, you don’t gain leverage over God by good works.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Luke 15:11-12 </b>&nbsp;"There was a man who had two sons.&nbsp; <sup>12</sup> The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me.' So he divided his property between them. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Wow!&nbsp; I’m at the point in life at which, from time to time, my parents will ask what of their stuff I’d like to have.&nbsp; The first time they mentioned that, it was a bit of a surprise.&nbsp; I didn’t want to “go there”, and still don’t.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this younger son has no trouble hitting fast forward with his dad’s life: “Give me my share of the inheritance now.&nbsp; Wish you were dead.&nbsp; See ya!”&nbsp; The normal response by a father in a traditional honor-shame society would be something along the lines: “You wish I was dead?&nbsp; By the time I’m done with you, you’ll wish you were dead.”&nbsp; Even if no violence was involved, the father would be expected to disown and disinherit the son.&nbsp; But not this father.&nbsp; This father does what the son requests.&nbsp; He dies, he divides his possessions, and the son leaves.&nbsp; What the son does not realize, the unintended consequence, is that, while the father actually lives on, albeit through much pain, the son begins to die.&nbsp; When the son returns at the end of the story, the father celebrates and exclaims, “This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!” (Luke 15:24, and see 15:32).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">What’s wrong with this younger son?&nbsp; His loves are out of order, disordered, inordinate.&nbsp; As Tim Keller says, “He loves the father’s things, but not the father.”&nbsp; Did he want the wealth for the sake of status, of freedom, of pleasures?&nbsp; We’re not told.&nbsp; But he loved the wealth enough to wish his father dead.&nbsp; “The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil” (1 Timothy 6:10, and see Hebrews 13:5).&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our loves, when out of order, get us into all kinds of trouble.&nbsp; We love our honor, and we bristle and fight to protect it.&nbsp; We love our job, and we enslave ourselves to keep it.&nbsp; We love our family, and we’ll become violent in its defense or we become incapable of saying “no” to our children.&nbsp; Jesus made the audacious statement: “Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.&nbsp; <sup>27</sup> Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple” (Luke 14:26-27).&nbsp; That is, to follow Jesus, your disordered loves, even loves for good things – and love of wealth can hardly be considered love of a “good” thing – even loves for good things must be laid down at the cross and set in order by God.&nbsp; We must lay down every idol, everything that we put in the place of God in our lives.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this particular, there is not much difference between the two sons.&nbsp; The older son, just like his younger brother, loves the father’s things more than the father and is willing to humiliate dear old dad publically at the great feast.&nbsp; The older son displays this lack of love when he declares, “For all these years I have been working like a slave for you” (Luke 15:29).&nbsp; On occasion, our boys, when home, might express some minor displeasure at a chore they are being asked to do.&nbsp; We’ll call them “Cinder-fella” and tell them, “This is why we had kids.”&nbsp; The truth is that our desire is to raise sons, not slaves.&nbsp; But the older brother valued stuff more than sonship.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">What’s wrong with the father?&nbsp; He doesn’t do the predictable thing, the socially acceptable thing.&nbsp; He doesn’t banish his son, disown him, beat him.&nbsp; When the son leaves, he leaves on his own.&nbsp; The father doesn’t hunker down and protect himself.&nbsp; Instead, he subjects himself to pain, humiliation, and loss.&nbsp; If he does the predictable thing, his son will not just be dead but the father will be “dead to him”, a wall will be erected that may not be possible to open.&nbsp; This father kept the door open.&nbsp; I love what the wise woman said to King David about reconciliation with his banished son: “But God does not take away life; instead, he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him” (2 Samuel 14:14).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Like the brothers, our loves get out of order.&nbsp; Like someone in a committed relationship, who gets too close emotionally to someone else, our loves are out of order.&nbsp; Maybe we protest: “But nothing’s happened.”&nbsp; But something has happened.&nbsp; Our loves are out of order.&nbsp; We’re controlled by what we love, whether it is the career, or the kids, or our peers.&nbsp; We can kill ourselves with work, but the job will never return the favor.&nbsp; It is idolatry.&nbsp; As Isaiah says, “When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you!”&nbsp; That ain’t happening any time soon!<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has done for us what the father in the story did for the son.&nbsp; Instead of disowning us, instead of visiting us with judgment and vengeance, he delivered us, “he was wounded for our transgressions”, he took the nails in his hands.&nbsp; And, as Jesus died on the cross, his only remaining property – his clothing – was divided among them, divided between us.&nbsp; Because of this, we can know true forgiveness, we can come home to God and discover the door already open to us, discover the one love that can forever capture our hearts.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Newton, the writer of the hymn “Amazing Grace” also wrote these lines:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our pleasure (younger brother) and our duty (older brother),<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
