<div class="MsoNormal">By Janet Coates, upon the donation of new altar candles:<br /><br />The six new Altar Candles are given to the Glory of God, as God’s gifts and love surrounds us, and as an honorarium to all that God has given to us, and in grateful recognition of my family’s past and present Methodist church members.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">First and foremost: I am acknowledging and honoring all that God has given to us and our family. I chose this gift because of what light, since childhood, has meant to me, and I wish to share some thoughts with you all. This gift is given because “God gave us light”. To me, the candles are a physical symbol which reflects that light. In the Old Testament, Genesis 1:14-19, “God brought humanity out of the darkness into light.” In the New Testament, John 3:17-21 and John 8:12, God gave us, “The Light of the World” and in John 1:6-12, John the Baptist witness about the true Light, Jesus Christ.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Since the early 1800’s through our lineage to Luther Peck and his five sons, we have practiced the Methodist doctrines and traditions. All five sons became Methodist preachers. The youngest, Jesse Truesell Peck, was ordained a Bishop in 1872, in the Methodist Episcopal Church in the Oneonta, New York Conference. Each generation taught the next generation of God’s gifts, of God’s love, and God’s sacrifice for us, of his only begotten son, Jesus Christ.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Last November, Pastor JP Bohanan encouraged us to meditate and prayerfully consider what we are thankful for. I am thankful for my rich Methodist family heritage, which has been passed on to two members of this church:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">David Ralph Coates; by your spirit, your words, your actions, and deeds of service, you have demonstrated, received, and acknowledged God’s love and Jesus Christ as your Savior. In the Christian spirit you have continued to raise and mentor other young men, as well as your son, in Methodist principals, Confirmation, and as Acolyte Coordinator.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Sean Christopher Sterling Coates; by your Baptism, Confirmation&nbsp; and membership of this church, and by your deeds of service, especially in Vacation Bible School, Tuxedo Bell Choir and Acolyte, you have acknowledged God’s love and Jesus Christ as your Savior.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I expect that both of you will continue throughout your lives, to be servants of the Lord.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I am thankful for being raised in a “Christian-Methodist-Bible-toting home”; where Bishops, ministers, laymen, missionaries and educators were often dinner guests; and music and great conversations abounded. I am grateful for my formal education at Wyoming Seminary and Syracuse University.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Pastor JP: Your journey here to Mountaintop, in my opinion has brought a revival of the old, coupled with the new. In your eight months with us, I see that this gathering (congregation), with your guidance, has been rejuvenated, revitalized, and reenergized.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Thanks be to God!<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Respectfully, <o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Janet Green Coates<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">9-Feb-2014</div>
