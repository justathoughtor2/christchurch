<a href="http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/the-church-responds-to-ebola">Check out the Ebola outbreak update page from The United Methodist Church.</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.westafricanwriters.org/2014/08/21/west-pointers-reject-government-of-liberia-offer-of-food-assistance/">Residents of the quarantined community of West Point, a slum in Monrovia, Liberia, reject government assistance:</a>&nbsp;(Article posted 21 Aug by Julu Swen on West African Writers, excerpts below)<br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Residents of the quarantined slum community of West Point have turned down the offer of the Liberia Government to assist them with food and water amidst an imminent food shortage. Speaking to WAW on a telephone line, Rev. Agrippa Nyentee who is a United Methodist pastor now trapped in the community said the government brought in 300 bags of rice (25kg) and 60 large bags of water which each contain 30 small plastic bags of drinking water on Thursday morning (August 21, 2014). “The food aid will create more confusion between the government and the people of the community,” Rev. Nyentee said.</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The UMC Liberia pastor said there are over 75,000 persons living in the community and supplying them with 1,800 bags of water is like a joke on the part of the Liberian government. He confirmed that authorities of the community were now holding meetings for their next course of action. “Some of the assistance we want from the government of Liberia is to open a corridor for business people to bring in needed food commodities.”</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://www.umcor.org/umcor/resources/news-stories/2014/august/0828urgencyebola">An update on the UMCOR response and United Methodist mission work in Liberia and Sierra Leone:</a></span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; line-height: 21px;">(dated 28 Aug)</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5em;">United Methodist missionaries,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/Explore-Our-Work/Missionaries-in-Service/Missionary-Profiles/Roberts-Evans-Helen" style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5em; text-decoration: none;">Helen Robert-Evans</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5em;">, who serves in Liberia, and</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/Explore-Our-Work/Missionaries-in-Service/Missionary-Profiles/Gbanga-Beatrice-Mamawah" style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5em; text-decoration: none;">Beatrice Gbanga</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5em;">, who serves in Sierra Leone, say that because of the Ebola crisis, many other areas of life are affected.</span><br /><div class="" style="background-color: white; border: 0px; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-top: 1.2em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“The markets are closed.
