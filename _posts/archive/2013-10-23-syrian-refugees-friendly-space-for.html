They seek shelter within their own country, but more and more so, in neighboring countries.</div><div class="article-editor-region">&nbsp;</div><div class="article-editor-region">The United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) is undertaking vital initiatives in support of Syria’s battered population. Among these is UMCOR’s work with implementing partner International Blue Crescent (IBC) to ease the plight of Syrian refugee children in Turkey.</div><div class="article-editor-region">&nbsp;</div><div class="article-editor-region">In the two years of Syria’s vicious fighting, some 600,000 refugees have fled across that border, about three fourths of them being women and children. IBC is focusing its efforts on children in the refugee “city” of Kilis, technically a temporary reception center built mainly of steel shipping containers and located just three miles inside Turkey’s border with Syria.</div><div class="article-editor-region">&nbsp;</div><div class="article-editor-region">Throughout the conflict, the harm inflicted on children’s education has been enormous—some 3,000 Syrian schools have been destroyed, and two million children have been robbed of their schooling—but, of course, every element of their upbringing has suffered too. The UMCOR/IBC efforts are designed to bring some remedy to that widespread damage.</div><div class="article-editor-region">&nbsp;</div><div class="article-editor-region">Read the <a href="https://www.umcor.org/UMCOR/Resources/News-Stories/2013/October/1017syriarrefugeechildren">whole story</a>.</div>
