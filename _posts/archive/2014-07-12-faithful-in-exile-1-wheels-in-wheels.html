<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LxH1aps6B5c" width="420"></iframe><br /><div class="MsoNormal">2014/07/06 Christ Church, Mountain Top; Holy Communion<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Prayer, Psalm 29<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Children, Matthew 17.1-9 (Transfiguration)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Message, Ezekiel 1.3 – 2.2, 3.1-3, 3.12-15<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">A year ago, on the first Sunday of July 2013, I preached here for the first time as the new pastor of Christ Church. The passage was one of my favorites – Isaiah’s vision of the LORD Almighty in the temple after the death of King Uzziah (Isaiah 6). It is a vision that is related to Ezekiel’s, a vision including amazing angel creatures, poetically described in vivid details and at the same time leaving many details to the imagination. It is a vision that totally destroys Isaiah. He cries out, “Woe to me! I am undone!” “Oy! I am melting!” Ezekiel has a similar reaction: “I fell on my face” (Ezekiel 1.28) and “I sat there stunned, for seven days” (3.15). In both visions, the prophets experience their call to ministry. Isaiah hears God wonder, “Whom shall I send and who will go for us?” and jumps up to declare, “Here am I, send me!” Ezekiel is too stunned to speak, too deep in grief to react. God picks him up, as if by the shoulders, and carries him about, declaring, “Mortal (the traditional “Son of man”), I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me” (2.3). Isaiah, too, gets the difficult task of preaching to people who have no interest in listening. “Say to this people: Keep listening, but do not comprehend” (Isaiah 6.9). I’m grateful that I am sent to people who listen (mostly).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">As much as these two passages have in common, there are huge differences. Isaiah’s ministry comes when Judah, the southern kingdom, is still vibrant and stable, though they have begun the always deadly walk away from their God. He speaks of a coming catastrophe, of conquest and exile. And, in the final portion of the book, he addresses the future exiles – long before their birth – with comfort, with the promise of return – return to their LORD, return to their land.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ezekiel’s ministry happens in that gap. He is part of the first generation of exile, and Judah remains a vassal state of Babylon. He is part of a brain drain (Darr, intro), a deliberate and cynical attempt to take the head of the civilization so that there will be no more rebellion, no more declarations of independence, no more “Tel Aviv Tea Parties” – just empire. But these exiles do not need comfort, they need a dose of real-politic, and a total dismantling of their sense of privilege in the world. They still believe that Judah will rise, that their return and triumph are imminent, that – as God’s chosen people – this is just a bump in the road. Ezekiel declares otherwise: Judah and Jerusalem face total destruction, exile will be longer than your life, and you have no spiritual privilege that exempts you from the call to live in obedience to God.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">There are also huge differences in the personalities of the prophets. They both preach judgment to people who won’t listen. Yet, Isaiah’s life and message are filled with beautiful songs, texts that even today we keep putting to new music. The songs that come from Ezekiel? Spirituals, slave songs, music for the oppressed, not music for the privileged. Ezekiel saw the wheel. Them bones, them dry bones. (I do have to say that some of the Isaiah songs are for the oppressed as well – but they were songs to begin with, not converted into songs later.) Ezekiel grieves, but he shows no emotion. He sees incredible visions – many of them – unlike most prophets who mainly hear from God. He uses absurd imagery and weird sign acts – laying siege to a figurative Jerusalem by lying on his side immobilized by God for 390 days, shaving his hair with a sword, and cooking his food over dried cow dung. Among all the eccentrics who served as Israel’s prophets, Ezekiel takes the cake.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">And he has a lot to say to us disciples of Jesus in the US of A. Though our Constitution says that Congress shall make no law respecting an “establishment of religion”, in this nation we had a long running cultural compact. Prayer in the schools, the Ten Commandments on the wall at the courthouse, a nativity set at the municipal building, and no stores open on Sundays. But times change, and the cultural compact has dissolved. Many grieve that loss, hoping, like Ezekiel’s exile community, for a return to that state of privilege. And it won’t happen. Our national values have been secularized and our population is becoming more and more diverse – and that can be a good and holy thing for us and our mission as disciples of Jesus Christ, if we are willing to learn some lessons from this unusual prophet.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">There are three key dimensions of the exile experience that are important to recognize in the context of this text, and to recognize – in dim parallels – in our own experience. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, is the displacement of change. Robin gets her hair done, and it is different. I tell her that she’s beautiful and that I’ll have to get used to the new hair. She’s used to this by now, after almost 25 years. Even good change displaces us – new carpet (but it’s not my favorite color), new leadership, new music, whatever. I just wish we all drove buggies and wrote hand written letters delivered by the Pony Express, like the “good old days”. Of course, the maternal mortality rate was huge, we had separate but equal accommodations, and domestic abuse was tolerated. No matter how much we may struggle with change in general or change in the church, we’ve got nothing on Ezekiel and the exiles of Judah. They were forcibly relocated from their native land, and they directly witnessed the slaughter, torture, and rape of family members and friends.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the loss of anchor traditions. Despite wandering from God, they still valued the temple, they still believed in God’s promise to the house and lineage of David. Now, however, there was no place for worship, no traditional duties for a priest like Ezekiel, no king. In the words of Psalm 11, “If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?” <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the pressure to assimilate. “Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated” (<i>Star </i>Trek). Once the traditions that anchor us are lost, how do we preserve our values, how do we pass them along to our children and grandchildren? Is it best to become total oddballs, or to totally fit in, or is there a third way – an alternate path to faithfulness that does not require the comfort of the familiar?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Into this context – one of painful change, disorienting loss, and severe pressure – the glory of God appears to the priest Ezekiel. Four living creatures serve as the chariot throne of the LORD, each with four faces and four wings, each with gyroscopic, eye-studded wheels. After that, Ezekiel struggles to describe the center of God’s glory, over and over using the phrase “something like”. Something like crystal, a throne, sapphire, a human form, glowing amber, fire enclosed, a rainbow.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a total aside, a word on faithful imagination: The popular descriptions we hear or read of heaven and the glory of God pale in comparison to the vivid words and overwhelming encounters that are reported in the Scriptures. Do we domesticate our dangerous God? Do we water-down the glory of the LORD? Do we tell the story in a way that makes Jesus seem boring?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The glory of the LORD appears to Ezekiel. There are a few themes, of many, that I wish to lift up from the vision to support and inform our discipleship, whether or not we share the visionary gift.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, mobility. The throne of God is not bolted to the temple floor or found in the king’s palace, or even up in some separate heaven. The throne of God is on the move – wings, wheels, darting “to and fro like a flash of lightning”. It is because of this mobility that Ezekiel knows that all is well with God even if all is not well with Jerusalem. And it is because of this mobility that Jesus says to a would-be disciple, “Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head” (Matthew 8.20-22 and Luke 9.57-62). Jesus calls us to step out, out of the four walls, out of our comfort zones, because we worship a mobile God who does not let the grass grow under foot.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, creation. The rule of God extends far beyond the boundaries to which we routinely limit it. The apostle Paul echoes this theme when he declares that the “entire creation waits in eager expectation” (Romans 8). The four living creatures have four faces – human, lion, ox, eagle. The sound of their wings is “like the sound the sound of mighty waters”, a phrase used throughout the Bible for the jumble of multiple voices, as an image for all humanity. Even empire, even Babylon the Great, will fall under the rule of God, whether for judgment or for blessing or both. Honor and care for all that God has made, and welcome the diversity of the human race, even loving our enemy.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, word. It is reassuring, to me at least, that the LORD comes to this prophet not only in vision but in word. He <i>hears</i> the word of the Lord and, even better for a guy like me, he eats a scroll containing the word of the LORD “and in my mouth, it was as sweet as honey” (3.1-3). There is no need for us to desire an encounter with God that runs counter to how God has made us. And, especially, there is no need for us to seek visions – we must seek only Jesus. If God sends visions, well and good, but seek Jesus. For every one of us, the Word is accessible. Read it, devour it, taste it, digest it. And, if reading is not your strong suit, there are a number of ways to get the audio for free.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Ezekiel’s language and imagery for the glory of God shows up in the gospel stories of the Transfiguration and in John’s visions in the Revelation. John’s gospel describes the glory of God as Jesus’s death on a cross. In the Revelation visions, both sides of glory are combined – crystal, rainbow, throne, angel creatures AND the Lamb slain. Today we share in Holy Communion and we come face to face with the glory of our LORD.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Katheryn Pfisterer Darr, 2001, Ezekiel, in <i>The New Interpreter’s Bible, Vol VI,</i> Abingdon Press: Nashville.<o:p></o:p></div>
