We said that, in order to retain our innocence, we must not only abhor violence. We must also abandon our identity as victim. And the path to innocence is love. “Love your enemies.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reconciliation is difficult work, and it is gospel work. “Hear the good news: Christ died for us while we were still sinners.” It is difficult enough when we are reconciling as equals – colleagues in the workplace, neighbors on the street, classmates at school, siblings in a family. But it is even more difficult when we are not equal. Biblically, we are all equal as God’s children – created in the image of God, bought with the precious blood of Christ. In social practice, however, the dynamics of power structure much of our interaction: management-labor, parent-child, teacher-student. And, when the dynamics of power are mixed with violence in word or action, the harm is huge.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s our focus this week – reconciliation of unequals, when power or violence are part of the picture. Next week we’ll conclude by examining reconciliation within ourselves.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We have examples in today’s Scriptures, but it is only the tip of the iceberg for both Scripture and life. Joseph has been too willing to take advantage of his special position, only inflaming the jealousy of his brothers. His brothers are too willing to solve the problem with force. Ten against one. And Joseph becomes a slave and later an imprisoned criminal, someone with no power at all. When the tables turn, when Joseph rules Egypt and his brothers come for food during the famine, what will he do with his new power?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus tells his disciples to “go the second mile”. It is not a saying about perseverance, hard work, or excellence. It is a creative response to power – to the privilege of a soldier in the Roman occupational forces to demand that a Jewish civilian carry their load from one milepost to the next. Going a second mile actually takes the power away from the soldier, from the occupation, because the disciple of Jesus is no longer under any compulsion, just the compulsion to love.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus says, “Turn the other cheek”. It is not John Wayne’s version – now that I’ve turned my cheek I’ll beat you up. It is a refusal to play the power game, to expose the exercise of power as the violence it is.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Abuse?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn the other cheek?

How vast is the sum of them! I try to count them-- they are more than the sand; I come to the end-- I am still with you.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">If there is anyone who thinks obsessively of you and me – with love and delight, not being a control freak – it’s our God.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Escaping an abusive situation is typically full of guilt. “If I try harder, things will be better”. Or, “I made my own bed”. And, as Christian people considering the possibility of divorce in an abusive context we have the extra guilt of “but the Bible says …”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus does condemn divorce, and when he does so he is talking about an ancient practice that actually abused women – making it easy for a man, who had all the economic power, to divorce a woman who did not please him and leave her to fend for herself in poverty. Jesus, in condemning divorce, was not encouraging persons who are being abused to remain in an abusive situation if they had any option. He was encouraging men to love their wives and remain faithful to them.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, what of the submission and headship language in the Bible? Well, it is in the book. While there are some translation issues that are worth exploring, it is equally plain – even in the context of headship and submission language – that the leadership of a man in a home is to be exercised through loving service and that submission is to be mutual.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her” (Ephesians 5.25). “Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ” (Ephesians 5.21). “Love your wives and never treat them harshly” (Colossians 3.19). “Show consideration for your wives … so that nothing may hinder your prayers” (1 Peter 3.7).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from paying attention to the context of submission and headship language, we must remember the amazing equality statements in the Scripture, little time bombs that only matured in later movements such as abolition, civil rights, women’s rights. “There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3.28). A marriage of unequals can become abusive. A marriage of equals is a beautiful gift.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We opened today’s message by introducing the theme of reconciliation among those who are not equal. Then, we explored one example of an unequal relationship – an abusive marriage – and some biblical perspective that supports a person pursuing freedom from abuse.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other kinds of abusive relationships. Far too many children are abused. And far too many persons are abused in their schools and workplaces in a variety of ways – hazing, harassment, bullying. We all bear the scars of people who were convinced that we were legitimate objects of scorn. And we are not. We are loved. It is the most important thing about who we are as human beings: We are God’s beloved. “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me” (Psalm 139.6).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible includes some amazing reconciliation stories between unequals. Joseph enslaved by his brothers. And, at the other end of the Bible, another slave story. Onesimus runs away from his master, a Christian man named Philemon. He meets the apostle Paul and becomes a Christian. After a period of working with Paul, Paul sends him back, letter in hand to Philemon: “I would appeal to you on the basis of love … no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother” (Philemon 9, 16). Aside from the great theology – that in Christ we are equals and slavery makes no sense – the letter to Philemon is a beautiful personal appeal to reconcile unequals, unequals whose hearts are profoundly transformed by Jesus.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Even in the place of deepest pain, we are called to “love your enemies”, to practice reconciliation and forgiveness, to extend the peace of Christ. Extending the peace of Christ is not the same thing as subjecting ourselves to additional abuse. Jesus’ peace comes with the desire and power for transformation. We are not asked to put ourselves at risk for greater pain from persons who are not ready to change. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, why practice this unilateral gift of forgiveness? It is effective in our hearts even if the other person has no idea we are forgiving them or no desire for us to do so. And, forgiveness is actually a necessary part of letting go. One of the main Greek words for forgiveness (<b><span style="font-family: Bwgrkl; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Bwgrkl; mso-bidi-language: HE;">avfi,hmi</span></b>) (aphiemi) means “to let go”. And, as long as we refuse to let our pain go, we remain bound to the other person in the cycle as perpetrator or victim.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tug-of-War, a power game.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go the second mile. Turn the other cheek. Flush the toilet. Opt out of the power game. Forgive.<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the path to innocence in relationships is love, a love that begins in the love of God in Christ Jesus, so the path to freedom in unequal relationships is forgiveness … letting go.<o:p></o:p></div>
