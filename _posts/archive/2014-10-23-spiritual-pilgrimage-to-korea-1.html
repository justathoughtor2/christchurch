Reflections from our District Superintendent, Rev. Dr. Tom Salsgiver:<br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you are probably aware, 32 pastors and spouses joined Bishop Park and his wife Lisa for a pilgrimage to Korea.&nbsp; It was a phenomenal trip.&nbsp; We not only learned so much, we observed churches alive and on fire for Jesus Christ who understands their sole passion is to bring people to faith in Jesus Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next several weeks I want to highlight some of the things that I found helpful, inspiring and what I believe is God directed.&nbsp; I hope some of the things that I write about will stir us in the Lewisburg District.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We visited 6 churches and the Methodist Seminary of Korea.&nbsp; All of the churches we visited are growing in numbers and in disciples.&nbsp; Some of the pastors were quick to point out that this is difficult because of the culture in Korea.&nbsp; Like the US, going to church is against the culture of the society in which they live.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Our host Church was the Bupyeong Methodist Church.&nbsp; They are the epitome of a church who cares deeply for its community and for the unchurched.&nbsp; They are also a church that takes hospitality to a new level.&nbsp; (I’ll talk about the hospitality in another article.) <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">One of the links of all of the churches growth was that they were crystal clear as to their mission as a church.&nbsp; Our host church understands that all they are about is bringing people to know Jesus Christ and to grow disciples.&nbsp; If it doesn’t fit these two goals—they don’t engage in it.&nbsp; It’s about their goal of bringing people to Jesus Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Another church we visited called themselves the Joyful Church.&nbsp; Their goal is to bring joy to the community through the Gospel of serving and to find ways to help make the community joyful in Jesus Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This joyful church sees as their mission field the children in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; To serve the children, they built—with church funds—a 3 floor community center for the church.&nbsp; The 3<sup>rd</sup> floor is a children’s library, the second floor a coffee shop for the community and the 1<sup>st</sup>floor a theater for performing.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is next to their sanctuary.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The pastor of this church said that they opened this as a place for children.&nbsp; He went on to say our only reason is to serve children in our community well.&nbsp; To that end, they now worship 1,100 adults and 1,400 children.&nbsp; They are clear about their mission and they do not stray from it.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span></div><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Another church we visited is known for its small group ministries.&nbsp; This church’s mantra is passion and creativity and they are burdened by the multitude of souls that need to be saved.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Their passion and creativity is shown in their unique ministries of an open Christian Culture Service, their dance company that is actively a part of worship, their drawing performance and sand animation.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">When this church was started 21 years ago they picked a location that was right next to the subway stop to attract new people and make it easy for them to come to worship.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This church is clear that their job is not to get members but to make disciples.&nbsp; So, in order to join the church, every new person must attend 40 <i>consecutive</i> days of small group where they encounter the Word of God and are paired with a mentor.&nbsp; The goal is to move people from being “almost Christians” to Disciples of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This church began in 1993 with 2 people and now they worship 5,000.&nbsp; Most persons who attend are young adults.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">All of the churches that we visited were very, very clear about who they are and what they are about.&nbsp; They are about bringing people to know Jesus Christ and helping Christian grow in their discipleship.&nbsp;&nbsp; They take serving very serious.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Their only function—the only programs and ministries they start and they continue are ones that get them to the goal of bringing people into a relationship with Jesus Christ and helping people grow in their discipleship.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">A real learning from these churches is that we need to be crystal clear what our goal is as a church.&nbsp; Once we know our goal, then we must align all of our ministries and all of our budgets and all of our energies to accomplish that goal.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">We say we are about making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world.&nbsp; Do our actions, our ministries and our budget point to that?&nbsp; Are we so focused on our goals that we are willing to stop doing things that don’t help us achieve our goal?<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clearly the churches we visited knew and understood their goal and they were razor sharp in their focus.&nbsp; And they found that God is blessing them.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">(The next observation will be about what the Korean Church learned from the US.)</span><o:p></o:p></div>
