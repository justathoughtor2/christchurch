<div class="MsoNormal">2015/04/03 Good Friday, Mountain Top Community @ St Paul Lutheran<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Matthew 27.11-26<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal">Poor Pilate. He doesn’t ever seem to have learned that there are more than two ways to address conflict, more than two ways to be conflicted. In addressing external conflict, the two easiest ways to identify are confrontation or capitulation. Fight or give in. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of being conflicted, the easy resolution is to pick one aspect of ourselves or another and just go with it. Either-or. No possibility of internal dialogue, just decide by listening to the loudest internal voice, the greatest threat.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don’t know much about Pilate’s personal life. He served as procurator of Palestine for ten years, though there were numerous complaints against him by those whom he governed. He seems to have satisfied his superiors for a while, but it finally caught up to him and he was deposed by his boss and sent to answer for his conduct before the emperor. According to one historian, he was sentenced to exile and eventually committed suicide (<i>Nelson’s Illustrated Bible Dictionary,</i> 842).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to his family life, all we know is that he was married and that he brought his wife with him to Palestine. If he was ever a father, I imagine that he might have learned to handle conflict a bit more productively. I remember how easy it was as a father to draw a hard line with my boys only to fold under the pressure of a three-year old’s persuasive power.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The title of this response is “compromise”. Compromise can be a good thing, and it would be nice (in my opinion) to see a little more of it among our political leaders. But, for Pilate, compromise was more like total capitulation. Whatever happened to my sense of principle? Whatever happened to my wife’s good advice? Whatever happened to my discernment of the jealous motives of the people around me? When we totally fold under pressure we give away a piece of ourselves. We think we are saving ourselves by caving to the pressure, but we actually lose our Selves. It is suicide by stages. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal">We face these pressures on a regular basis in our lives. Answer the phone for your boss and tell the customer that your boss is not available. Come to the porn party with the rest of the team. Go along to get along, even though the company is not living up to its stated values, the very values that are the reason you took the position. Don’t come to the company picnic with your same-sex partner; bring an opposite-sex friend so you can look the part. Laugh at the racist or off-color joke. Give up confidential information to make yourself look better or more important.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">One of the important ways we deal with conflict is to be clear about who we are. When we are clear about that, we can more easily turn threats into opportunity (<i>Rocking the Boat</i>, Meyerson), more effectively respond with creativity. But even more important than clarity about who we are is to know for certain who Jesus is. And this story reveals Jesus, even more than it exposes Pilate. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus is the innocent one, guilty of no evil, who dies for us. We might expect that when his blood is “upon us” that we bear guilt and live under wrath, but the incredible and surprising gift is that his blood cleanses us from all sin. Just as his death brought about the release of Barabbas, so his death effects our freedom. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus is the king, not simply of the Jews, but of the entire human race, of the entire earth and universe, of our entire history and its future. We can trust him, and his word, to lead and guide us. We can trust him, and his love, to hold and carry us. And we are called to obey. In conversation with Pilate, he gave no answer. But his very presence demands a response, one which Pilate, on that day, could not give. Instead, in order to save himself, he actually lost himself.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Notes:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Service Cycle:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Response of Mockery, The Chief Priests and the Scribes<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Response of Denial, Peter<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Response of Compromise, Pilate <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Response of Indifference, The Soldiers<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Response of Loyalty, The Women <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Response of Faith, The Thieves<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;">The Response of Love, Jesus&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div>
