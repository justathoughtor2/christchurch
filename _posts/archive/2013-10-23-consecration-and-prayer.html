<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KP0DTQOkAX0" width="420"></iframe><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When asked by <st1:personname w:st="on">Mike</st1:personname> Traficante to be on the Stewardship Team, I quickly agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then I had to miss the first meeting at which the plan for delivery and content of speeches was made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My lesson to learn: Never miss a meeting!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My assignment was to be the first speaker and the content was to be prayer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Okay, how do I relate prayer to stewardship?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first course of action that I knew was to turn to the Bible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So here goes: </span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"></span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are two parables in the New Testament that I would like to draw upon and paraphrase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The first is from Luke Chapter 18: verses 1 thru 6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The story is about a godless judge and a widow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The widow came to the judge repeatedly to seek justice, but he ignores her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This goes on for days and days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally the judge says “This woman is driving me crazy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I will see she gets justice because she is wearing me down!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even as this judge rendered a just decision, surely our God will grant petitions by people that plead with him frequently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"></span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The second is not so much a parable but a lesson from Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is found in Mark Chapter 9: verses 19 thru 29.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After giving the disciples the instructions to go forward and heal in his name, there was one child they could not heal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The boy was having what we call convulsions in today’s world, causing him to fall into fires or into water that could cause his death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/null" name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The child’s father brought him to Jesus, and Jesus prayed and healed the child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When asked by the disciples why they could not heal the child, Jesus referred to the power of prayer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span></span><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"></span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">How do we relate these stories to our stewardship and our prayer?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obvious answer is that I would ask you to pray, search your heart, thank God for the many blessings He has given you, and ask how you can increase your giving either monetarily or in service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But as a congregation, how can we relate prayer and stewardship?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the congregation prays for an increase in budget and missions, imagine the good that can come of that!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If our individual giving increases our budget will support the music, education, and camp scholarships the church supports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Christ</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">United</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">Methodist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Church</st1:placetype></st1:place> will be the church that becomes synonymous with community service and events!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Can you imagine community bible studies held in our education wing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Or small group meeting taking place in homes of our members? As a congregation we could offer to pay the cost of members that wish to share their knowledge and expertise to underdeveloped countries like Robin just did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the budget is increased we will be able to meet our ministry shares in the Conference that support World Wide missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If our service increases, more individuals may be called for mission trips or paths of service such as the Christmas Boxes and food bank that we just assisted in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Imagine that if God hears our individual prayers given consistently and answers, how much more so if the whole congregation were to pray!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"></span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So I respectfully ask you to pray during this time of stewardship contemplation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pray for your individual giving, that you may be led to increase your monetary giving and/or your service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Pray as a part of the larger congregation, that Christ United Methodist may grow and serve to “Make more disciples for Jesus Christ for transformation of the world”. </span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thanks to Jane for sharing this word on Sunday Oct 20.</span></span>
