<div>Government protests and the Methodist Church:</div><div><br /></div><div><div>The Methodist Church here led by its President, Revd Tin-Yau Yuen, has called for the government to keep calm and not to abuse force. The Tiananmen Square incident is still fresh in the memories here. The Chinese Methodist Church in Wan Chai is also a hub of activity with people bringing</div><div>hundreds of items in support of the protestors; water bottles, fruit, bread buns, crackers, first aid items, masks and more cling film than you can shake a stick at!</div><div><br /></div><div>Revd Yuen and some of the church staff are sleeping at the church to be available when needed. The&nbsp;</div><div>commitment of Methodists here is incredible and the church has become a place of sanctuary for&nbsp;</div><div>the protestors. The Chinese Methodists have called for regular prayer and staff and members of the&nbsp;</div><div>Methodist International Church are standing with them. We are praying for peace in the community&nbsp;</div><div>but also understanding from the government and proper dialogue with Beijing.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.hk-mic.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hong-Kong-Protests.pdf">Read the full story.</a></div>
