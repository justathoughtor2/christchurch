<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FiJj7-wtSok" width="420"></iframe><br /><div class="MsoNormal">2014/04/20 Christ Church, Mountain Top, Easter, Communion<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Prayer, Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Children, Matthew 28.1-10<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Message, Romans 6.3-11<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Easter. Resurrection. But no Walking Dead, no Umbrella Corporation, not even a zombie unicorn apocalypse. Jesus was dead, he is now alive, he will never die again – and he is no Zombie Jesus. And no apocalyptic summer blockbuster either.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">What is this crazy story? Myth? Metaphor? An ancient sci-fi or fantasy? Some of us are so familiar with the story that we yawn and ho-hum our way through the motions on Easter. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ is Risen! Christ is Risen indeed! Alleluia! <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Some of us are here only to please a family member – and, honestly, it’s a good thing to make momma happy (Murphy). When momma ain’t happy, ain’t nobody happy. Some of us are out-and-out skeptics, even if we show up here every week. This resurrection thing it not simply irrational but beyond imagination. (And, I’ll admit, I feel sorry for folks with such a stunted imagination, but I digress.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In Paul’s letter to the Romans, he invites powerful imagination. He takes the story of personal transformation – something he imagines as impossible without Jesus – and overlays it with Easter, with Exodus, and with Creation.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Creation (Ziesler): In chapter 5, he talks about the human story encapsulated in Adam, the first human, the proto-human. In Adam, all our stories are found. In Adam, we sin, and we die. But, Paul tells us, there is a new Adam, a new proto-human, with a new story: Jesus. In Jesus, we are righteous, and we live.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Exodus (Wright): Here in our main text, Paul uses baptism language in a way that aligns with Israel’s deliverance from slavery in Egypt through the Sea. It is only through water that we experience God’s gift, “newness of life”. He even uses slavery language to describe the human condition apart from the grace of God: “That we might no longer be slaves to sin” (6.6) and “Death is no longer master over him” (6.9).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Easter: In the Sacrament of Baptism, powerfully visualized in baptism by immersion, we are buried with Christ, we die with Christ, we are crucified with Christ, we are resurrected with Christ. And, here is where we discover that the gift and promise of Easter, and the imagination required to appreciate it, is so huge, so much larger than we thought.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ is Risen! Christ is Risen indeed! Alleluia! <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal">A couple major stories (Katz, Eden) have been published this week on Yasiel Puig, the “absurdly talented phenom” (Rymer) of the LA Dodgers. Last year, in his first season in major league baseball, he hit .319 (starting when he was called up in June), and hit .333 in the playoffs. Despite being in the minor leagues the first two months of the season, he finished in second place for Rookie of the Year in the National League. But this week’s stories are not about his accomplishments in sport, but about the story of his 2012 defection from Cuba – a story of imprisonment, assassination, death threats, human trafficking, captivity, immigration, and drug cartels.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Cuba, Puig was paid $17 a month to play baseball; after his escape, he signed a $42 million free agent contract with the Dodgers. It’s still planet Earth, but it might as well be a whole ‘nother world. And to pass from one world to the other, to begin a new life, he had to go through a death. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Perhaps Paul’s language, and the Resurrection story, is not such an irrational idea, and unimaginable tale, as we may think. For Paul, Jesus’ death and resurrection opens the door for us to a new life – not just in a time yet to come but beginning now. Pope John Paul II, following Paul’s ideas long before he became Pope, wrote his <i>Easter Vigil 1966</i>poem and named Jesus “the Man who became the Body of History”. The Apostle Paul used the same language on a much more personal tone with the Galatian disciples: “I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me” (Gal 2.19-20). Jesus’ story – death and resurrection – becomes our story as we are “baptized into Christ”.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ is Risen! Christ is Risen indeed! Alleluia! <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Over 20 years ago, I was stuck. I needed to move in a new direction, but I couldn’t figure out how to make a move. My father-in-law told me, “Don’t let your past define your future.” Great advice. Difficult advice. I have learned to live by it, learned to die and embrace new life. I have discovered for myself that it is only possible because Jesus Christ has opened the door, because of Easter. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you are mired in a depression you can’t imagine ever being in the past. There is newness of life. Maybe you are stuck in a relationship that is violent or abusive. There is newness of life. Maybe you find yourself in a dead-end job. There is newness of life. Maybe you are beset by self-destructive habits. There is newness of life. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus is the “body of history”. In his death, we die to our past, whatever it is. In his resurrection, the door is opened to an Easter future.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ is Risen! Christ is Risen indeed! Alleluia! <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The main difficulty of the passage from Romans 6 is the language about freedom from sin. We hear that, we look at our lives, and we conclude – nope, not yet anyway, maybe I don’t believe hard enough (as if that were possible), maybe I don’t try hard enough, maybe Easter just doesn’t work, or doesn’t work for me.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we miss when we struggle with this language is that Paul is not talking about sin in terms of human behavior but talking about Sin in terms of a Power, as a violent slave master, that rules and dominates our lives with destructive and lethal force. He is using the language of Exodus (Wright).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel had lived in slavery for over 400 years. In a cataclysm of plagues and then through the water of the Sea, God delivered them. They were no longer slaves. Pharoah no longer had dominion over them. They were no longer subject to abuse. But they had no idea how to live as free people. It took time. All the facts on the ground were new. The reality that defined and shaped their life was freedom. And they had to learn to live in it. Yasiel Puig has to learn to live in a new world. I had to learn to live in a new future.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, that’s exactly what we need to do. When Paul describes freedom from sin in Romans 6, he is using the imagery of Exodus to describe the power of Easter. He is speaking about the new reality that we are no longer enslaved and dominated by Sin and Death. He is describing the new facts on the ground, the freedom, the “newness of life” in which we are called to live and learn. We can learn it. We can live it. Because it is no pipe dream, fairy tale, or scifi adventure. It is based on the new facts on the ground, on an event in history that changes everything.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;">As surely as Christ is crucified, so we have died to our old way of life.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;">As surely as Jesus’ tomb is empty, so Sin and Death are emptied of their power. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;">As surely as Christ is risen, so we are unstuck, free to live gloriously, victoriously.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Easter.
