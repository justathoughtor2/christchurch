Christ is risen. Christ will come again,” the Easter story can get a little stale. We know how it ends, we are familiar with the foregone conclusion, even more certain than an undefeated Kentucky team finishing the season at the top of NCAA men’s basketball. In fact, if you like upsets, you might even start rooting for the story to end with Jesus dead: When the women got to the tomb, they found the stone sealed shut, the soldiers refusing entrance, but after a little bargaining, they were allowed in to anoint Jesus’ dead body with myrrh, an ancient embalming perfume. Then, they left to prepare macaroni salad and turkey sandwiches for the funeral dinner. Because it’s OVER.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Ben Franklin said, “Nothing is certain in this world except death and taxes” (BrainyQuote.com).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Instead, the women show up and Jesus is missing. The tomb is empty. And, by the way, while history and science can never prove something like resurrection, there is plenty of evidence to support the history that Jesus died by crucifixion, that his tomb was empty, and that his followers believed him to be risen.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women show up and Jesus is missing. No wonder they are “shocked and silent”, or, in the words of the text before us, “alarmed”, in “terror and amazement”, “afraid”, and saying “nothing” (16.5, 8). The most ancient copies of Mark’s gospel that we have end the account right there. What we see after verse 8 in our Bibles is from later copies. This is one of the very few significant textual questions in the Bible, which, given the ancient history of the text, is actually quite amazing and, compared to other ancient texts, much more reliable by a huge margin. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid” (Mark 16.8). I love this cliff-hanger ending. It has many implications and it is remarkably consistent with the literary style of Mark’s gospel. I just want to raise one of these implications: Resurrection is a surprise ending, an ending that changes everything.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal">Jesus was crucified by his own people as a blasphemer who declared that God’s kingdom was for the poor and that the beloved community was for the outcast. And, in his death, that vision of the kingdom and beloved community died. Jesus was crucified by the Roman authorities as a rebel who proclaimed freedom for the slave. And, in his death, that hope for freedom died. Jesus was crucified in the deepest pain of “God-forsakenness”. “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Mark 15.34). And, in his death, he is forsaken to the uttermost.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ has died. Christ is risen! The outcast has a home. The poor have a kingdom. The slave is set free. And God becomes Father to all the forsaken (Moltmann, 85-98).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal">In 1 Corinthians 15, the Apostle Paul makes a lengthy argument regarding the necessity and the historicity of Christ’ resurrection. Everything in the Christian faith hangs on the resurrection. He writes, “If Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain. … If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins” (1 Corinthians 15.14, 17).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are someone who likes the universal love and inclusive vision of Jesus’ kingdom, it does not exist without Easter. If you are someone who values human rights and individual liberties, well, they cannot exist even in imperfect form without Easter. If you appreciate the fact that God embraces the broken and accompanies the forsaken, none of that is possible without Easter.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal">No wonder those first witnesses, those apostolic women, originally shocked and silent at this huge surprise ending . . . no wonder they began to tell the story.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Jurgen Moltmann, <i>The Church in the Power of the Spirit.</i><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/death_and_taxes.html">http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/death_and_taxes.html</a><o:p></o:p></div>
