Church members and volunteers helped new arrivals with bus tickets, showers, clothing, food and other provisions for travel across the U.S., while managing material and financial donations from caring citizens. <br /><br />To support a holistic response to the more than 62,000 refugees who crossed the U.S.- Mexico border, the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) issued a $100,000 grant to the Southwest Texas Annual Conference to support the conference’s immigration ministries at its welcome centers through June 2015. <br /><br />The funding will provide personnel support, relief supplies, training and coordination, including the hiring of a director of United Methodist immigration ministries. This person will coordinate the church’s response to the influx of refugees, host volunteer groups, manage donations and aid, and serve as a contact person on the immigration crisis in and beyond the region. The director will also advocate for fair and humane treatment of immigrants, both in society at-large and in the U.S. legal system specifically. <br /><br />You can support this effort and other critical events that develop in the United States with your gifts to <a href="http://gbgm.convio.net/site/R?i=B-_c-FnDjUD4hQRFEvJaLg">U.S. Disaster Response, Advance #901670</a>.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />
