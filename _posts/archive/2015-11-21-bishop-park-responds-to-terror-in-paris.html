Our hearts go<br />out to the grieving families and the loved ones of the innocent victims of the<br />terrorist attacks in France this past Friday. They are in our prayers for comfort,<br />strength, and healing. While still in shock and disbelief, we share their agony and<br />pain.<br /><br />The world shall never forget that terrorism is the most despicable crime against<br />humanity. No matter what the cause may be, terrorism must be condemned. In<br />solidarity with the human community; our resolve to end terrorism must only<br />grow stronger.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Even in these most trying times, let's be reminded that God is with us. We put our<br />faith in our God whose steadfast love, goodness, and mercy endures forever. We<br />put our hope in the Lord who judges in righteousness, governs with justice, and<br />rules for peace. We can be assured of God's power that triumphs over the force of<br />darkness and death.<br /><br />As people of faith and hope, the most essential thing we have to do, and we can do<br />now, is to pray. I would ask our people to have a moment of prayer in silence or in<br />spoken words during worship this Sunday. You may want to use the following<br />prayer or prayers of your own:<br /><br /><em>O God, we pause in silence and reflection because once again evil has invaded&nbsp;</em><br /><em>sharply into your world with all its vengeance and power. We are particularly&nbsp;</em><br /><em>mindful of the persons who have lost their lives and their families and loved ones. We&nbsp;</em><br /><em>lift up for healing those persons who were injured and are fighting to live. We pray in&nbsp;</em><br /><em>solidarity with those who are directly affected by the horrible tragedy as they now&nbsp;</em><br /><em>live in fear and pain. May your presence bring a sense of calm with the assurance&nbsp;</em><br /><em>that you are with them even in these darkest days. O Lord, provide wisdom for those&nbsp;</em><br /><em>who must lead and respond in the midst of these horrendous events.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>God, we also pray for ourselves that we might be a people who are not quick to&nbsp;</em><br /><em>condemn entire nations or a particular religious faith because of the extremist acts of&nbsp;</em><br /><em>terror of a few. God, your people throughout the world call upon you as their creator.</em><br /><em>They too have been harmed by the actions of these terrorists. Lord, may we learn how&nbsp;</em><br /><em>to live together in peace and with a respect for all persons regardless of race, color,&nbsp;</em><br /><em>creed, or religion.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>God, you are the Creator and Author of this life and when you looked at that&nbsp;</em><br /><em>creation, after every act, you declared it good. Truly the world in which we inhabit is&nbsp;</em><br /><em>magnificent with the hues of humanity and everywhere we look we see evidence of&nbsp;</em><br /><em>your creative power, presence and beauty. You intended for humanity to live in&nbsp;</em><br /><em>harmony with you, nature, each other and our own selves. To that end, O God, we&nbsp;</em><br /><em>once again recommit to work for peace in the world. As the hymn writer expressed it,&nbsp;</em><br /><em>"Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me."</em><br /><br /><em>We pray these spoken and unspoken words in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord</em><br /><em>and Savior we worship, the Prince of Peace we follow, Healer of our brokenness we&nbsp;</em><br /><em>represent, and Hope of the world we proclaim. Amen.</em><br /><br />Grace and Peace,</span></div><div align="left" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div align="left" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Jeremiah J.
