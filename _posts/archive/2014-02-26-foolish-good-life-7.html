To confess and testify to the truth as it is in Jesus, and at the same time to love the enemies of that truth, his enemies and ours, and to love them with the infinite love of Jesus Christ, is indeed a narrow way. To believe the promise of Jesus that his followers shall possess the earth, and at the same time to face our enemies unarmed and defenceless [<i>sic</i>], preferring to incur injustice rather than to do wrong ourselves, is indeed a narrow way. To see the weakness and wrong in others, and at the same time refrain from judging them; to deliver the gospel message without casting pearls before swine, is indeed a narrow way. The way is unutterably hard, and at every moment we are in danger of straying from it.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonhoeffer, 211<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Two gates and two ways<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Good trees with good fruit; bad trees with bad fruit<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Wise and foolish builders; foundations of stone and sand<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">These three figures in series divide the human race, divide perhaps the kingdom itself, divide even the individual human being – body and soul.&nbsp; Over and over the crucial question is obedience.&nbsp; “Everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them” (7.24).&nbsp; “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven” (7.21).&nbsp; “Thus you will know them by their fruits” (7.20).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My personal reading: Ezra – study, do, teach (Ezra 7.10)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal">The crucial question is obedience.&nbsp; But it is too easy for us to reduce this to moralism, to legalism, because the word we must obey is not explicitly stated here.&nbsp; We like to have a list, we like to check it twice.&nbsp; We forget that at the beginning of this message, Jesus repeatedly drilled down beneath the surface of the commandment to the state of the heart, from adultery to lust, from murder to anger.&nbsp; Later in Matthew’s gospel, a man came to Jesus and asked what he needed to do to have eternal life.&nbsp; Jesus told him to keep the commandments.&nbsp; “Which ones?”&nbsp; Jesus listed several.&nbsp; “I have kept all these.&nbsp; What do I still lack?”&nbsp; “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.&nbsp; Then come, follow me” (Matthew 19.16-22).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no checklist for the kind of obedience Jesus requires.&nbsp; It is simple, and simply impossible.&nbsp; It is total, and totally impossible: Give up everything to follow Jesus.&nbsp; Give up everything to be Jesus’ friend.&nbsp; Jesus isn’t looking for moralists who keep all the rules.&nbsp; Jesus isn’t looking for employees who follow the handbook.&nbsp; Jesus isn’t even looking for miracle workers who do powerful things.&nbsp; Jesus is looking for friends, friends to follow him, friends to live with him.&nbsp; When he says to the miracle workers, “I never <i>knew</i> you” (7.23), the Greek word used for “know” is a word for knowledge gained through perception (not research or employee records) and direct experience.&nbsp; It is used euphemistically for sexual intercourse (Friberg lexicon).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus is looking for friends, people he knows because they have given up everything to be known by him.&nbsp; It is that call – the word of the Lord – &nbsp;and obedience to it, that sets us apart as his people.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>1 Corinthians 3:11</b>&nbsp; For no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid; that foundation is Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Paul’s comment reminds us that the obedience of faith is not moralistic or legalistic, it is all about Jesus – knowing him, being known by him, becoming his friends.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Abraham, “friend of God” (2 Chronicles 20.7, Isaiah 41.8, James 2.23)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Gen 22.12, “now I know” (Abraham offering Isaac) “that you fear God”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus is looking for friends, people he knows because they have given up everything to be known by him.&nbsp; When he sees that, he declares, as he did over Abraham, “Now I know”.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <i>The Cost of Discipleship, </i>"The Great Divide"<o:p></o:p></div>
