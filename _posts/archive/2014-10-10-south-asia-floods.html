The United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) is responding with emergency assistance through its partners on the ground in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India-controlled Kashmir.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">In Pakistan, September monsoons submerged low-lying areas in three provinces, damaged electricity and transportation systems, collapsed homes or roofs, and caused extensive crop damage. The storms left at least 190 people dead and 350 injured. It is the fourth consecutive year of deadly monsoons in Pakistan.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">With implementing partner, Church World Service, UMCOR is providing emergency food and non-food supplies to 249 vulnerable families in Azad Kashmir, Bagh District. Supplies include wheat flour, rice, cooking oil, sugar, salt, full kitchen set, sleeping mats, mosquito nets, and others.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">In Bangladesh, UMCOR is working with partner Muslim Aid to provide emergency food supplies to 2,100 families in the northwestern part of the country, which was subjected to fierce rains and flooding in mid-August. Here, too, the most vulnerable households, among them those living in poverty, the elderly, and those living with disabilities, will receive assistance.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">In India-controlled Kashmir, 200 people have died in the region’s worst monsoon season in more than half a century. Hundreds of thousands of people remain stranded by floodwaters in Kashmir Valley.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">UMCOR is working with partner Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA) to provide 800 families in Kashmir with emergency food and non-food supplies. UMCOR also is working with partner GlobalMedic to provide 500 families with household water purification tools and to supply 25 public water purification systems in 10 villages.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Your gifts to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://secure3.convio.net/gbgm/site/SPageNavigator/umcor_donate.html?type=1002&amp;project=982450" style="color: maroon; text-decoration: none;">UMCOR International Disaster Response, Advance #982450</a><span style="background-color: white;">, supports the work of UMCOR and its partners when disaster strikes.&nbsp;</span></span>
