<div style="font-size: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center;"><strong>"God is our refuge and strength,</strong></div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>an ever-present help in trouble" (Psalm 46:1)</strong></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span>Dear United Methodists of  the Susquehanna Conference:</span></div><br /><span>Grace to you in the name of  Jesus Christ, Prince of Peace, Healer of our Brokenness, and Hope of the  World!</span><br /> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span>On Friday, November 8th,  Super Typhoon Haiyan crashed into the Philippines. It was probably the most  powerful typhoon ever recorded. While it is still much too soon to know the  complete effect of the storm, it is feared that over ten thousands lives have  been lost and hundreds of thousands of people are displaced and in dire need of  relief. The cost to rebuild the devastated area will be astronomical. In the  midst of the immediacy of the natural disaster, our beloved connectional church  stepped forward to respond immediately. The United Methodist Committee on Relief  (UMCOR) has already been mobilized to be present. The initial response of UMCOR  is to distribute food and water and offer other urgent care for humanitarian  needs. Then other appropriate responses will follow as time unfolds. At present,  perhaps the most efficient way that the people of the Susquehanna Annual  Conference can initially respond is through our financial gifts. We have been  supported by the general church in the past when we were in need, and now we can  respond again on behalf of God's people.</span></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span>You and your congregation  can make a gift to your local church in support of the victims of Typhoon Haiyan  through UMCOR. Please be sure to indicate on the memo line of your check that  the gift is in support of International Disaster Response Advance 982450. Your  church treasurer will then send a composite check from your local church to the  Susquehanna Annual Conference in order that your local church is credited with  your gift. You can also give directly through the UMCOR website. Your church can  also be credited with your gift using the UMCOR website. You can go to <a href="http://www.umcor.org/">www.umcor.org</a> </span>and  click on the "Typhoon Haiyan Emergency - Donate Now" box.</div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span>I solicit your prayers for  the people of the Philippines. Please continue to pray for them and for the  relief efforts. Despite the gravity of the situation, such moments remind me why  I am glad that I am part of a global, connectional church that has the structure  and the ability to respond immediately. Truly, God has blessed us as a people  that we might be a blessing to others for such a time as this.</span></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span>With You in Christ's  Ministry,</span></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span>Jeremiah J.
