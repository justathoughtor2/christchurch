This is because this tradition is unique to Harare East District (HED) in the Zimbabwe Episcopal Area as was acknowledged by Bernard Banda who said, “HED is the only district that holds such a revival at such a large scale, which has impact and is successful”.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #0a1b8c; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">DS Rev Madziyire got a revelation in 2009 while on spiritual leave. She felt that God spoke to her and said to her that there is victory through fasting and prayer. But that there are people who don’t understand it and some who fear fasting, therefore as a pastor it was important to teach people to put this into practice and therefore a call to group fasting.<br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #0a1b8c; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">Initially the revelation was for the group fasting to happen once or twice a year but the Connectional Ministries chairperson at the time Rev. Daniel Chitsiku made a recommendation to the district conference of that year and the conference made a resolution to have the revivals three times a year instead of just the two. The revivals are now a yearly occurrence in January, July and October.<br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #0a1b8c; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">DS Rev Madziyire said fasting is a biblical concept and that there are 8 records of fasting in the bible ranging from half a day to 40 days. She was quick to say,” If the author of the church who is Jesus Christ fasted to begin his ministry who are we not to fast as the one we follow fasted? John Wesley the author of Methodism used to fast on Wednesday and Friday. Therefore fasting is a special discipline for Methodists”.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #0a1b8c; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 10px;"><br />She said John Wesley lived by the policy that, if you could not rule the belly how then would one be able to rule the church. Methodists have always observed the 40 days of fasting during the lent period. &nbsp;<b><a href="http://www.umczea.org/158-fasting-a-tradition-well-kept.html?j=84742&amp;e=lcarey@umcom.org&amp;l=460_HTML&amp;u=2436987&amp;mid=6206185&amp;jb=1">Read the full article</a></b> from the Zimbabwe Church!</div>
