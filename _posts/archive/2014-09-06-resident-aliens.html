<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I spent the summer of 1987 doing mission work in Spain. Toward the end of the summer, I was helping to prepare a storefront for the “grand opening” of Centro Cristiano, a church in Béjar. I got to paint the metal grillwork that framed the windows and glass doors, a tedious job that suited my temperament and gave me time to reflect.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I meditated on some recent Scripture reading, including the remarkable words of Paul to the Philippians: “But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ” (Philippians 3:20). I grew up internationally, knowing the value of citizenship in one nation while living as a resident of another.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The church was located in a neighborhood of modest high rise apartments and condos, on the first floor of one of the buildings, open to a common square with room for kids to play. One of the children came up to me and we struck up a short conversation. “Where are you from?” “From heaven.” <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Not exactly the best way to open a conversation and invite it to continue! The kid just walked away as I continued to paint. Just as I was born a US citizen without ever being in the country (until later), so my citizenship is in heaven, though I’ve never been there. And that status defines everything about who I am in the world – a “resident alien”. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I want to encourage you to be part of the adult Sunday School class this fall as they read and interact together over the book <i>Resident Aliens: Life in the Christian Colony,</i> by Stanley Hauerwas and William Willimon. Joel Shuman will lead the discussion, beginning 14 September. (On 7 September, the class will kick-off with an edition of Bible Jeopardy.) You can order your book through the church office or yourself. If you need assistance with the cost of the book, please let us know. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Together on the journey!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Pastor JP</span></div>
