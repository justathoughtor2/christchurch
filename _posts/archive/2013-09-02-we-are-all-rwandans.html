A wonderful and moving article by Christopher Heuertz on the <a href="http://www.qideas.org/blog/we-are-all-rwandans.aspx">Qideas site</a>:<br /><br /><span id="contentBody">In the summer of 1994, as the frenzy of Rwanda’s 100-day genocide neared its end, a number of the <em>Interahamwe</em> (the pro-Hutu youth militia responsible for most of the estimated one million massacred Rwandans), crossed the boarder to hide in Congo. A few years later, these paramilitary fighters came back into Rwanda to complete their “unfinished business.” They conducted vigilante raids to kill Tutsi and claim loyalty from Hutu survivors.<br /><br /> In the small town of Nyange in western Rwanda, on the cold, rainy evening of March 18, 1997, shortly after dinner, but before returning to their dormitories, a number of St. Joseph’s Secondary School students gathered to study for their exams.<br /><br /> Suddenly, a group of Interahamwe insurgents attacked the unassuming campus. The night watchman—campus security—was executed. Immediately following his murder, 27 students were forced into a classroom and ordered to separate—Tutsis on one side, Hutu on the other. But the students refused to separate themselves.<br />Check out the <a href="http://www.qideas.org/blog/we-are-all-rwandans.aspx">full story</a>.</span>
