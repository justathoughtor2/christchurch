Audience appearing in the stories<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Verse 1 introduces the <b>first group in Jesus’ audience</b>: the “tax collectors and sinners”.&nbsp; I don’t know anyone who is fond of paying taxes, but in the ancient world, tax collection was a job accompanied by spite, intimidation, deceit, and corruption – and, on top of that, it was done for the occupying power.&nbsp; And, who are “sinners”?&nbsp; We can get all biblical and quote the line “all have sinned” (Romans 3.23).&nbsp; But this word was used as an expression for those whose reputation preceded them, for those who were known to be good at being bad.&nbsp; We are told that these folks are “gathering around” or “coming near” Jesus.&nbsp; The verb, in another form, means “join end to end”.&nbsp; I imagine not just a handful or even a cluster of “tax collectors and sinners” but a crowd, pressed together, joined together shoulder to shoulder like so many dominoes – all of those trains connected to Jesus.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In verse 2, we meet the <b>second group in Jesus’ audience: </b>Pharisees and scribes.&nbsp; These folks are “good people” – they are religious, obedient, upstanding citizens, pillars of the community.&nbsp; And complaint ripples, muttering flows through their part of the crowd: “This guy accepts sinners – and eats with them!”&nbsp; They see the world in good and evil.&nbsp; How can Jesus be good if he fellowships with evil people?&nbsp; As for us Pharisees and scribes, we have “no need of repentance” (15.7).&nbsp; That’s beneath us, and these tax collectors and sinners are beneath us.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Obviously, the tax collectors and sinners aren’t beneath Jesus.&nbsp; He replies to the muttering of the “good Jewish people” or “good Christian people”, but indirectly in story form.&nbsp; These stories were not designed to make us feel good but to press the buttons of the righteous folks, to challenge their assumptions.&nbsp; Even today, when we look at the details of these stories, they challenge us and our assumptions about sin and salvation, about being lost and being found, about God and the human race.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Being lost: Lost in Laos:</b> At 4 years old, tried to catch up to Dad when he went on a run.&nbsp; Thought my life was over (Greek term for “lost” here is also for “perish” or “destroy”.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was foolish; I thought I could run as fast as my father.&nbsp; Yes, I was preschool, so maybe it doesn’t count against me.&nbsp; Either way, I was lost.&nbsp; One of the wonderful things about this series of stories is that they provide us a multi-dimensional picture of lostness.&nbsp; In the words of Timothy Keller, “the sheep is lost through foolishness, the coin through thoughtlessness, and the son through willfulness.”&nbsp; Are we lost like the sheep, foolish, not paying attention, and ending up who-knows-where?&nbsp; Are lost like the coin, that is, is it something that happened to us, something out of our control?&nbsp; Are we lost like the sons, willful, stubborn, and disconnected from the Father?&nbsp; How about “all of the above”?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keller writes, “Sin is deeply complex.&nbsp; It is inborn in you, it is magnified by sinful treatment, and it is deepened and shaped by your own choices”.&nbsp; (Notes for pastors, session 2).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Casey’s lost keys ...</b> Things that are lost don’t find themselves.&nbsp; They need to be found.&nbsp; The sheep doesn’t find its way home.&nbsp; The coin, the keys, don’t leap into the hand of their owner.&nbsp; And, the son doesn’t come into the feast without the father going out to him, or the mystery young man in Laos brining him home.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Religion is all about the human search for God.&nbsp; Most of us think that if we search hard enough, if we live right enough, if we believe firmly enough, we’ll find God.&nbsp; But that’s not what Jesus says in these stories.&nbsp; The biblical story is that we are LOST, and that God comes to us first.&nbsp; When the LORD met Moses at the burning bush, the LORD declared, “I have heard the cries of my people and I have come down to deliver them” (Exodus 3.7-8).&nbsp; John writes, “We love because God first loved us” (1 John 4.19).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first story, the shepherd goes looking for the sheep.&nbsp; In the second story, the woman searches high and low for her coin, probably a piece of her jewelry, part of her dowry, and her only status symbol.&nbsp; Elsewhere in Luke’s gospel account, Jesus describes himself as the “Son of Man” who “came to seek out and to save the lost” (Luke 19.10).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Joy: </b>Because the Pharisees and scribes “have no need of repentance”, they see themselves as superior to sinners, as people who are definitely NOT lost.&nbsp; According to Jesus, “there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance”.&nbsp; The writer to the Hebrews tells us that it was for this joy of finding us, “for the joy set before him” that Jesus “endured the cross, scorning its shame” (Hebrews 12.2).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “More joy in heaven”.&nbsp; I think the Pharisees and scribes sensed this in Jesus.&nbsp; They were grumbling because Jesus “welcomes sinners and eats with them”, but it really got under their skin that Jesus enjoyed it, that Jesus just loves being around sinners, that Jesus takes pleasure in being with people who are good at being bad.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “More joy in heaven”.&nbsp; When we are found by Jesus, when we repent and “come near” to him, God is throwing a party!&nbsp; Have you sensed that pleasure, that joy of Jesus over finding you and bringing you home?&nbsp; If not, today’s a good day to get over your goodness, to get over your righteousness and come home.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “More joy in heaven”.&nbsp; If you have found your home in Jesus, then it is our greatest privilege to play “match maker”, to introduce people to Jesus, the lover of our souls.&nbsp; We speak of our mission as to “make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world”.&nbsp; There is no greater joy that being part of introducing people to Jesus.&nbsp; None of us do it alone.&nbsp; We are always part of a larger story.&nbsp; But no matter what part we play, we bring joy to Jesus, joy to all of heaven “over one sinner who repents”.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Timothy Keller, <i>The Prodigal God</i> and notes for pastors<o:p></o:p></div>
