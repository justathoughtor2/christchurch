In my prayers on Wednesday, I read Psalm 12 and was struck by the end of verse 8:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">That which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.</blockquote><br /><br />How often are my priorities shaped by "everyone" rather than by the love of God? I want to renew my focus on what matters most.
