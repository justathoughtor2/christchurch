<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9; color: #7c7c7c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;">My name is Promise Paidamoyo Kapumha. I am a 20 year old Zimbabwean lady. In April 2012, I had the privilege to attend the Africa Leadership Summit which was organized by Young Peopleâ€™s Ministries of GBOD in Nairobi, Kenya. During this summit we had a lot of activities which were strategically planned to ensure that we would make the most of our time in Nairobi. We had a series of educational presentations from various presenters on topics which mostly affect us as the young leaders in Africa. I learned about the qualities of a good leader; both as a church member and also as a citizen of my nation and in my community. I also learned a lot on dating and relationships as a young leader in church; what love means and how to have meaningful and fulfilling relationships and do it in the way God expects. We had a time for group discussions during which we all shared our experiences in leadership from the different parts of Africa. We realized that we were facing common problems as young people serving the Lord and as leaders in the United Methodist Church. As a result, we shared solutions that we would each carry back to our countries and make a difference. When I returned to my country and shared these solutions with others it surely made an impact.</span></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9; color: #7c7c7c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9; color: #7c7c7c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;"><a href="http://globalyoungpeople.org/promises-story/">Read the full story!</a></span></div><br />
