<div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Our thoughts and prayers are again with the people of Peshawar, Pakistan, in the wake of a December 16 terrorist attack on a school, which has left more than 145 school children and teachers dead and many others injured.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">We join with the Church of Pakistan, our mission partner, in praying for all those who have been affected by this latest attack and for a future of peace and security in the region.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">It is not the first occurrence of this type. On September 22, 2013, some 90 people were killed and dozens injured in Peshawar when two suicide bombers attacked All Saints Church on a Sunday morning as worship concluded. Peshawar is located in the far northwest of Pakistan, near the border with Afghanistan.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Our friend Insar, who lost two children and other relatives in the church bombing, informs us by email that Peshawar is “very tense” after the attack on the school. Insar is the youth coordinator of the Diocese of Peshawar of the Church of Pakistan, a union of Protestants in the country. Pakistan and the Peshawar region are predominantly Muslim.</div><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #666666; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white;"><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/learn-about-us/news-and-stories/2014/december/1216pakistancallforprayer">Read the whole story</a></span></span>
