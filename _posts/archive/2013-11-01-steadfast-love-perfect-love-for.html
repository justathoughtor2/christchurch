<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kOjgMZidd4k" width="420"></iframe><br />Thanks to Joel for closing out this series of messages from the prophet Hosea 11:1-11.<br /><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">Prayer: <o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">Lord, open our hearts and minds by the power of your Holy Spirit, that as the scriptures are read and your Word proclaimed, we may hear with joy what you say to us today. <o:p></o:p></span><br />  <br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">Listen again to the words of the Psalmist, who looks forward to the time when: “Steadfast love and faithfulness will meet / righteousness and peace will kiss each other. / Faithfulness will spring up from the ground, / and righteousness will look down from the sky.” These words join with those of the eleventh chapter of Hosea in reminding us this morning of one of the biblical story’s most persistent themes: The love of God for his creation is steadfast. It is immeasurable, unconditional, and altogether trustworthy. No matter what we have thought, said, or done, the God whose story is told in scripture, the God of Israel, Jesus, and the church, stands forever ready to welcome us; to receive, forgive, and ultimately to transform us. In the end, when all is said and done and when history reaches its completion, God’s creation will be redeemed. There will be no more turning away from God; there will be no more idolatry; and there will be no more selfish exploitation or injustice. For in that day, “steadfast love and faithfulness will meet.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">This is not exactly news to those of us who have gathered here these past weeks, listening to the words of the prophet Hosea. For the singular message of Hosea is that ultimately, even as his people break his heart, God’s love remains steadfast. Over and over again the prophet proclaims this, as he goes from warning to lament to assurance; there is no force in heaven or on earth stronger than the love of God. In our text for this morning the prophet uses a new metaphor to make this point: God is no longer depicted as the faithful husband of a promiscuous wife; rather, he is a longsuffering parent whose love for his wayward child persists in spite of that waywardness.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">The eleventh chapter begins with this fond reminiscence: “When <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region> was a child, I loved him, and out of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> I called my son.” Hovering in the background of Hosea’s words is the story of the Exodus, God’s deliverance of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>from bondage in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>to freedom in the land of promise. When the descendants of Abraham called out from their bondage to the God of their ancestors, the story tells us, God remembered the promises he had made to their ancestor, promises to bless his descendants and to make them a blessing to the peoples of the earth. And so God freed them from slavery and began the slow, patient work that Hosea describes as teaching them to walk. God began making them into a holy people, a people set apart to demonstrate to the world the extent of God’s love, a people whose character was to mirror and manifest God’s character, a people whose common life, built on the foundation of what we now call the Ten Commandments, was ordered toward making it possible for them to attain true happiness – that is, to flourish – as individuals and as a community. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">That foundation begins, as we were reminded last week, with this reminder and exhortation: “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.” True and ultimate happiness is impossible unless life is oriented toward and ordered by the One who makes it (happiness) possible. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint Augustine</st1:place></st1:city> put it well when he said (to God), “You have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.” Human desire is bottomless. Unless and until it is directed towards God, it consumes. In calling Abraham and his descendants, in revealing himself to them and giving them a law through which they might learn properly to love him, each other, and the rest of creation, God was freeing them from the bondage of relentless, restless, self-centered desire. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">And yet, says God through the prophet, “the more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols.” Set free from bondage and given the perfect freedom of fellowship with their creator and his creation, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>instead chose, time and again, to reenter bondage by worshipping the cruel and capricious Canaanite gods, the Baals. As has been the habit of the human race from the beginning, when given the choice of entering into God’s embrace or turning away from that embrace, Israel turned away, alienating themselves from God, and suffering, finally, the consequence of that alienation, the destruction of their promised homeland and their being scattered away from it.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">But still, in the midst of all this disobedience, God remained – and still remains – faithful. “How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I give you over, O Israel?” God’s love is steadfast, and God keeps his word. Just so, God promises to re-gather his people from their diaspora, to restore them to the land, and to make them once again a light to the nations of the world. “They shall go after the Lord, who roars like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west.” God’s love is moving history toward its completion, and that completion, we are reminded, includes – indeed it centers on – the restoration of God’s people. “They shall come trembling like birds from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>, and like doves from the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">land</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename w:st="on">Assyria</st1:placename></st1:place>; and I will return them to their homes, says the Lord.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">This is good news indeed, this reminder of God’s faithful, steadfast love, this reminder that God’s ultimate intention for all of his creatures is their salvation. It is at the core of the gospel Jesus proclaimed when he called upon people to “repent, for the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">kingdom</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename w:st="on">God</st1:placename></st1:place> is at hand.” And yet, I wonder if we Christians have followed <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> in forgetting this, or whether we have heard it so often that we have long since begun to take it for granted. I wonder whether we, whom God has called by name, have like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> turned away from God and toward idols of our own or others’ making. I wonder whether our worship remains devoted to the one true God, the only one with the power to save, the only one with the power truly to bless.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">This concern may seem to many of you misplaced and even anachronistic. Where, you ask, are these idols you are so worried about? Where are these Baals, these carved statues, these golden calves? Where are the temple prostitutes and the human sacrifices? And the easy answer to those questions is that they no longer exist and are no longer temptations for God’s people. It has, I admit, been a while since I’ve seen a golden calf, and in Mountain Top, at least, temple prostitutes are nowhere in sight. At first glance, at least, all seems well with God’s people where idolatry is concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">But the matter of discerning the faithfulness of our worship may not be quite as simple as it first appears, for worship is a complicated business. Certainly it is something that we do for more than an hour on Sunday morning. The word “to worship” comes from an Anglo-Saxon word that means, simply, “to ascribe worth” or “to find worthy,” which means the true object of our worship is whatever we regard as most important, whatever we find worthy of our time, our energies, and our resources. And this suggests, quite simply, that who or what we really worship is revealed, ultimately, by the way we live our lives. My friend Philip Kenneson puts it this way when he says; “Every human life is an embodied argument about what things are worth doing, who or what is worthy of attention, who or what is worthy of allegiance and sacrifice, and what projects or endeavors are worthy of human energies. In short, every human life is ‘bent’ toward something. Every human life is an act of worship.” </span></div><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"></span>&nbsp;</div><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">The philosopher Wittgenstein once said, “If you want to know if a man is religious, don’t ask him; watch him.” What would someone carefully watching us say that our lives were bent toward – not just on Sunday mornings, but for the rest of the week, as well? What god or gods would they say we worshipped? Would they identify us as worshippers of the God of Israel, Jesus, and the church, or would they say that our lives were bent toward something else altogether? The Baals of the Canaanites still exist, appearing freshly reincarnate to each generation of every society. In our time and place they are many; people and products clamoring for our attention; corporations, governments, political parties, and other institutions, demanding our absolute allegiance; and what Jesus called Mammon – money and power – seducing us into bowing down to them. All of them ask of us things that are properly reserved for God alone. All promise us a happiness that they can never deliver. All have in mind simply to use us up for their own aggrandizement, to consume us, and in many cases ultimately to destroy us. And all the while, the triune God, whose nature is to love, whose character is to remain faithful, whose work in history is sovereign, and whose desire for us is our true happiness, waits patiently, wooing us, gently calling us to repent – that is, to turn – away from our idols, and toward him. </span></div><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"></span>&nbsp;</div><div class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">God offers this to us as a pure and perfect gift. God offers to transform us into a holy people, a people whose life together declares to the world the goodness and the steadfast love of God. For God, who is altogether righteous, seeks from us what he has sought from the beginning, a people who will worship him alone, a people of whom it can be said that “Faithfulness will spring up from the ground, and righteousness will look down from the sky.” May we continually respond to his invitation, with joy and thanksgiving. Thanks be to God.</span>&nbsp;</div>
