Israel’s long slide into dissolution, begun more than 200 years earlier with her division into northern and southern kingdoms, looked to be complete. In spite of the repeated warnings of the prophets to turn away from their idolatry and their exploitation of the poor, the Israelites had continued their disobedience by deciding, after the fashion of humans before and since, to do things their own way. The northern kingdom of Israel, also called Ephraim, had long since fallen to the Assyrians, who killed thousands and scattered the remnant to the four winds. More recently Babylon had invaded the southern kingdom of Judah, laid siege to Jerusalem, and destroyed the city, tearing down its walls and razing its temple. Thousands, taken mostly from among the upper classes and skilled artisans, had been forcibly transported back to exile in Babylon, thousands more had been killed, and the remnant left without hope, aimlessly wandering the desolate, devastated landscape that had once been their home and the principal theater of God’s work in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">God’s covenant with Abraham, which promised to make of his descendants a great people through whom the whole of creation would be restored to its original <i>shalom</i>, was but a faint memory. And the covenantal promise of God to King David, to raise up from among his descendants a chosen one whose reign would have no end, looked to be little more than a cruel joke. No wonder the best the exiles could do was, in the words of the Psalmist (Ps 137:1), dejectedly sit by the rivers of Babylon and weep as they remembered Zion. Israel was, as one commentator says, “well and truly dead…. The word of Genesis 2:17 – [the warning that the eventual cost of alienating themselves from God would be death] – has finally been fulfilled: the clash between God’s will for his human creatures, by which alone they live, and their refusal to follow that will, has been worked out in the history of Israel and has come to its inevitable conclusion” (Jenson, 281). <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Into that moment of ultimate despair, the eccentric priest and prophet Ezekiel, himself among the exiles, was – perhaps unwillingly – thrust. In one translation of the text, the prophet says “God <i>grabbed</i> me. God’s Spirit took me up and set me down.” Shown a vast, open valley strewn with thousands of dry, bleached, and disjointed bones representing the long since (literally and figuratively) dead people of God, Ezekiel is confronted directly by God, who demands of the prophet (v. 3), “Mortal, can these bones live?” At first blush it is an absurd, even cruel question. Of course these bones cannot live, for they are “no longer even skeletal, so definitely of the past that the bones have separated and preserve no personal identities—no one can even point and say, ‘Alas, poor [so-and-so] … I knew him well’” (Jenson 281). In response to such absurdity, Ezekiel could only respond, probably a bit unconvincingly, “God only knows.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And yet in spite of the abject nature of the circumstances, God had a radically different view, an altogether distinct perspective on the future – the future of Israel and all creation – for with God, as we often need to be reminded, <i>all things</i> are possible. Just so, God commanded Ezekiel to do what Ezekiel was accustomed to doing, to prophesy; to speak to the bones, reminding them, effectively, of this very thing; that God is sovereign, even over death, dismemberment, and decay. So Ezekiel prophesied. And lo and behold, even as the prophet spoke, the bones began to rattle as they came to life: first bone reoriented to bone, then joined together with sinew, then covered by flesh and skin, and finally, in a clear echo of Genesis 2:7, filled by God with the very same breath of life that transformed the earth-creature, Adam, from an amorphous pile of soil into a living human person, made in the image and likeness of God. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ezekiel’s visionary prophecy to Israel is gospel – that is, good news – all the way down, for it not only foretells the improbable restoration of God’s chosen people, but also proclaims the power of God to bring about the salvation of every member of creation by way of a love that is more powerful than the worst of Israel’s (and our) disobedience, and stronger even than death itself. Graves will be opened; the dead will be raised; and the people of God will be restored, to be led by the promised eternal heir to the throne of David. God’s people will once again flourish, and they will once again be holy, their life together bearing witness to all creation of the steadfast love and endless mercy of the God whose ultimate aim is to bless all that he has made.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">II.<o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Appearances have for some time been indicating that the end is coming, and that it will decidedly <i>not</i> be a happy ending. One need not be any kind of expert to see that the world and its human inhabitants today are in a tight spot, and that things are soon likely to become a good deal worse than they now are. The enmity between Israel and the Palestinians grows as the fighting between them escalates, with this being but one instance among many of worsening violence in a world that seems increasingly “red in tooth and claw.” Self-interest has supplanted cooperation and hate speech now substitutes for civil discourse in an ever-more divided society, in which the notion of the common good, for centuries central to Christian social teaching, is at best ignored as obscure and at worst regarded as an artifact of a dangerous ideology that serves only to threaten individual liberty. The global exploitation of children – by the worldwide sex trade, by would-be dictators and ersatz freedom fighters in the global south, by violent gangs in the cities of Central and South America, by a neglected and decaying public educational system – has become not just tragic, but nearly unspeakable.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Even as the stock market reaches record levels, the disparity in both wealth and income between rich and poor widens as the middle and working classes fade slowly into oblivion and the growing underclass falls through gaping holes in an increasingly tattered safety net. In spite of some admittedly imperfect recent efforts to improve things, millions still go without adequate health care. Diseases of the poor, like childhood asthma, type II diabetes, and in some places even tuberculosis approach epidemic levels, and life expectancy among the poor and certain minority groups is actually decreasing.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And perhaps most alarmingly, many of the earth’s large ecological systems, its biomes, systems of which we are members and upon which we and all other creatures depend for our very lives, stand on the verge of collapse, due in large part to the voracious habits of consumption that are the very foundation of our way of life. The fossil fuels we depend upon, not only for heat, light, and transportation, but also for things like pharmaceuticals, plastics, and fertilizers, are in ever-shorter supply and increasingly hard to access without hazarding even more serious damage than has already been done to the earth beneath which they lay. Breathable air is in many cities a luxury, and potable water is in ever shorter supply, such that many experts predict that the nastiest wars of the twenty-first century will be fought over access to clean water. Chronic drought and annual wildfires ravage parts of the world while regular flooding causes nearly irreparable damage to others. Large-scale tropical deforestation robs us of precious oxygen-producing trees and contributes to the extinction of species at the highest rate in recorded history. Every year tons of agricultural topsoil washes into our watersheds, carrying with it the residues of dangerous agricultural chemicals and expanding a huge “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico, an area where there exists literally no marine life.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I could go on, for there is plenty more bad news, and we ignore it at our peril. But I have hopefully made my point. Unlike Israel, we are not yet dead. But our trajectory is unmistakable, and perhaps, some say, irreversible. Just so, a version of God’s question to Ezekiel becomes God’s question to us: “Mortals,” he demands of us, “can this creation live?”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Where Ezekiel initially replied hesitantly, unconvincingly, and perhaps even a bit cynically, we stand at something of a different place. Though things look from many perspectives to be terribly bleak, we are blessed with the gift of knowing, at least provisionally, the answer to God’s query. For in spite of our manifold weakness and our complicity in the sin that has brought us and the rest of the creation to this point, we stand on the backside of the signal event that changed the direction of history and initiated the fulfillment of the promise God made through Ezekiel, a promise made to Israel and to us. That event, of course, is the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth from among the dead. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">III.<o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul insists that for all those who are in Christ, those united to him in baptism, there is a new creation. Death is defeated and history has taken on a new trajectory, such that we look forward, anticipating neither the steady growth of a technological progress that will eventually deliver us from the mess we’re in nor an ecological cataclysm marked by rising oceans, disappearing coastlines, a lack of arable land, and inadequate supplies of clean water. Rather, our expectation is that all things will be redeemed, and that the earth’s original <i>shalom </i>will be restored. The new creation begun in Jesus’ declaration, that God’s reign had commenced, will be consummated by the descent of the garden city of the New Jerusalem, the place of God’s dwelling with his creatures. That is one account of the end game, the ultimate future toward which we may look.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Yet, although from the perspective of faith the outcome of history and the restoration of creation is in some sense assured, we are absolutely not excused from proclaiming and especially from embodying God’s gospel truth, for having been united to Jesus in his death and resurrection, we are bound to live as citizens of the kingdom he proclaimed and embodied, living peaceably with and loving our neighbors, our enemies, and the creation of which we are members. Having been made part of God’s people, grafted by baptism into the Israel of God, how can we do otherwise?<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">From the time Israel was given the <i>sh<sup>e</sup>mah</i>, in the book of Deuteronomy, God’s people have been called to love; first God, then each other, then the stranger among them. Love, as my good friend Keith Wasserman frequently reminds me, is a verb. It entails action, doing concrete good for the benefit of the beloved, be they family, friend, neighbor, enemy, or even the particular place on earth one finds his or her beloved occupying. The great command to love God and neighbor therefore entails loving the creation, for creation is in some sense, as the church father Athanasius said, “God’s [very] body,” given to us, like our own lives, as a gift and a loan. It is placed in our possession as a gratuitous expression of God’s love, an extraordinary blessing from which we, like every generation preceding us and every one following us, draw life. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The great questions that confronted Israel from the time of Abraham to the time of Ezekiel and beyond are the same questions that confront us today. Having been made heirs of God’s promised blessing, will we live in such a way that that blessing is extended to our near and distant neighbors, such that they, too, may be blessed and enter into worship of the one God who makes, sustains, and redeems all things? Or will we hoard it, fighting with those same neighbors and even among ourselves without regard for God or neighbor until we, like Israel, are “well and truly dead?” Will we take advantage of the freedom God offers, trusting God to care for us through the righteous, modest use of the good gift of his creation, or will we continue to demand for ourselves more than we need, plundering God’s gift without regard for the giver or those others with whom we are called generously and peaceably to share it? For us, as for Israel, one way separates us from God and leads ultimately to death, while the other draws us into the blessing of God’s provision and leads to life. Signs indicate that much of humanity has in recent history chosen the former option, and now faces a time of reckoning. Yet even as that reckoning comes, even as we confront the consequences of generations of unhappy choices, even as we face the specter of the possible destruction of the earth that sustains us, we may hear the voice of God, coming to us in the form of a question, but one which is also an invitation, an invitation to repent, putting aside the way that leads to death, and taking up the way of God. In doing so, we just may witness God doing the miraculous, giving new life to dead bones. Thanks be to God.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div>
