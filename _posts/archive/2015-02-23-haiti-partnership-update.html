<span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Haiti Partnership sent a team of nine from Central United Methodist Church in Honesdale to Petit Goave to work at an agricultural school in Vialet. Much needs to be done to reopen this school but the possibilities are endless.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It was really exciting to be the first team on this work site. We all truly appreciated how important this school can be to Haiti and it's people.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The week was very rewarding. We worked on the security wall and helped prepare the directors house for future teams to stay on site.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The local church brought a group of 60+ children for VBS each afternoon. We told Bible story's, acted out skits, played games ( the children LOVED the parachute and beach balls!), had snacks and just had a blast. By the end of the week, many of the local children came and joined in. We delivered back packs with school supplies to a local school. The school seemed so small, especially when the director told us it usually hosts up to 500 students! The students come in 2 shifts so all can be accommodated.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">We visited an eye clinic and donated 30 pair of eyeglasses that a local optometrist gave us. Our interpreter was Jean Claude. He was buried in the rubble in that particular clinic by the earthquake of 2010. He shared his story of survival with the team on the 5th anniversary of the earthquake. And then to visit the site -it gave us all goose bumps!</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">For more information about the Haiti Partnership, please visit our website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haitipartnership.com/" shape="rect">www.haitipartnership.com.</a></span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Jodi Crimmel</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Haiti Partnership</span></span>
