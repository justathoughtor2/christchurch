In the tradition of John the Baptizer, a great friend of mine and a director of UK Soccer was in Mountain Top in mid March on behalf of UK Soccer. Before he came, he called and asked if there was anything he could do for us in the transition. He returned with contact info for a men's over-40 team, for a pick up soccer opportunity, and an application to coach with the local Mountain Top Youth Soccer Association. He also discovered that the MTYSA secretary is a member of Christ Church! Thanks Steve, and thanks to Carrie at MTYSA!
