It is a passage that has been appropriated in the Christian tradition to refer specifically to Jesus, who offers us “my blood of the new covenant” for the “forgiveness of sins”. This is an appropriate and biblical usage of the theme, yet we must remember that the first time the Scriptures describe the “new covenant” is around 600 or more years before Jesus, as a promise given to our Jewish friends and neighbors. We must remember, as well, that this new covenant, which Jeremiah describes in contrast with the old, nevertheless utilizes language associated with that covenant with Israel at Sinai, language associated with Torah.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in the new covenant, “I will put my law (Torah) within them” and “they will all know me” (Jeremiah 31.33, 34). And we hear Moses declare, “The word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe” (Deuteronomy 30.14). And, before Jeremiah, the prophet Isaiah writes, “The earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11.9; see also Habakkuk 2.14). There is a contrast between old and new, certainly. There is also continuity.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Jeremiah’s ministry takes place during the final days of the Jewish state of Judah. The northern kingdom, Israel, what is spoken of today as the “ten lost tribes” has already been destroyed. In the south, Jerusalem becomes weaker and weaker, both in military might and political capital. What bothers the prophet most, however, is that they are wandering further and further from their God. “You have lived as a prostitute with many lovers – would you now return to me?” (Jeremiah 3.1). Yet, in this oracle, God offers hope: “I will build you up again and you will be rebuilt, O Virgin Israel. Again you will take out your tambourines and go out to dance with the joyful” (Jeremiah 31.4).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way of disobedience is at the center of why the new covenant is necessary. “It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them out of the land of Egypt, a covenant which they broke” (31.32). Two weeks ago, we read the basic commands of that covenant, the “top ten” originally engraved on tablets of stone. What we didn’t read is that while Moses was up on the mountain receiving these commands – away from the people for forty days and nights, the same time frame as Lent – Israel decided that they needed a visible god. They made a golden calf, offered sacrifices, threw a wild party. When Moses saw it in action, he threw down the stone tablets, breaking them at the foot of the mountain. But it was already broken by the people of God living “as a prostitute”. Last week, we looked at another story of broken covenant. This time, no idols and no orgies, just lots of whining and complaining. Sometimes, it takes us a long time to learn our lessons and we only learn, it seems, the hard way. A new covenant is necessary for all of us.<o:p></o:p><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Write it on their hearts (1) – Motive</b>(not purity of but location of)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From stone to heart<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I said so<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children and parents<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers and bosses – even pastors!<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I love you<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Write it on their hearts (2) – Pain<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">2 Corinthians 3.3 – “You are a letter of Christ, prepared by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write: En-Grave<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Cut a covenant” (the Hebrew expression for “make a covenant”)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theology of pain ... a path to<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transformation (Jesus “learned obedience by what he suffered”)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intimacy<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truth<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Note: Not a pursuit of pain for pain’s sake, but a theology of pain, a recognition that pain is a part of life and we need to think about our own pain in terms of faith and in relation to God.&nbsp; This is not about answers or about simplistic ways to feel better.&nbsp; And, we must be about the work of Jesus in bringing healing to the pains of our community and world.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Knowing God<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationship/Love (as a way of knowing), rather than reason or doubt<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth class on relationships – what do you love about Robin?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equality – “no longer shall they teach one another … from the least to the greatest”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Forgiveness<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes it all possible: “for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more” (31.34)<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our faithless hearts – a prostitute with many lovers – are forgiven … and transformed.
