</span>So, well intentioned leaders make boneheaded decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The coach wants to protect a lead by keeping the other team from scoring, but becomes so conservative that his team can’t keep possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Society wants “proficient” children, so we create a test to measure that and teach to the test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Because we get what we measure ... only we forgot to actually measure what we want to get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Business wants to “right size”, but ends up eliminating their most profitable people ... because they are measuring the wrong things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Luke’s gospel: Foolishness.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Warren Buffet, the “Oracle of Omaha”, says, “I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Because, sooner or later, one will.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Most of the time, the general scorecard for success is clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You win the game by scoring more than your opponent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You succeed in school by getting A’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You get into college, or, “the right college”, you get a job and you make money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’ve got a market economy, and we use market valuations (such as net worth, or “net income projected over time” [Reeb, 34]) to define a life, to determine success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And, the one with the most toys wins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The measuring is easy, but what if we are measuring the wrong things?<o:p></o:p></span></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Luke 12:15 </b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one's life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Making a living is not the same thing as making a life (Bob Buford, in Reeb, 31).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Do not confuse the measurement of one for the other.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Luke 12:18 </b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. <o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This rich fool was confusing the measurement of one thing for the existence of another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At the very pinnacle of success, when he had accomplished more than he had imagined, he loses everything and has nothing left.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lloyd Reeb, a former real estate developer and now the director of Halftime Ministries, tells the story of a friend, Rob, whose company was growing hand over fist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Rob told him over coffee that “he could easily continue growing his company at exponential rates, but he also [knew] in the end it will be just like Monopoly: ‘All the pieces go back in the box’”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Reeb’s conclusion: “Many of us spend much of our time driving the next quarter’s earnings, even while our potential impact on eternity slips past us on all sides” (22).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Foolishness.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Today’s Scripture contains two stories: First, two brothers are arguing over the inheritance and one of them wants Jesus to make the other divide it more fairly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Jesus declines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Not, I think, because he wants to avoid what is patently an impossible situation to satisfy, but because he wants to push the man deeper: “Be on your guard against ALL kinds of greed.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“One’s life does not depend upon one’s belongings, even when they are more than sufficient” (trans by Fitzmyer, 967).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The brother wants what he does not have, believes that having it will make him more secure than he already is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How much does he need?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Just a little bit MORE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But “more” is deceptive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It promises but can never deliver “enough”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>“More” is easy to measure, “enough” much more difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And we routinely confuse the two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Foolishness.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The second story is told by Jesus to unwrap the deceptive craving for more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A rich man – already rich, already with large barns – has a harvest greater than he can imagine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He recognizes it as surplus, but it quickly becomes what he needs, it quickly is transformed into security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But wealth, no matter how great the surplus, can never be a true security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Next year, we’ll need bigger barns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Or, tomorrow we may die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Surplus is easy to measure, security much more difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And we routinely confuse the two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Foolishness.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This rich man has an interior conversation, a talk with his own soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But he forgets that we have an <i>eternal </i>soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He confuses time, a long time by the measurement of his surplus, with eternity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So, he never reckons on death, and never reckons with God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He never heard the old saw, “I never saw a hearse pulling a U-Haul.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And the meaning of his life can be found in what he tells his soul to do: “Eat, drink, and be merry”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is a quote from Ecclesiastes 9.7, a book on meaninglessness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Meaning in Ecclesiastes 9 is simply being alive: “A living dog is better than a dead lion” (9.4).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Foolishness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In the traditional language of Ecclesiastes, “Vanity of vanities”.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We know meaning is more, but meaning is so hard to measure that we substitute other things for meaning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>George Murray said that the rich fool was foolish because he confused surplus with security, time with eternity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The problem is a universal human problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All of us struggle with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There are a couple reasons it is important for us to recognize our saints: One, it provides us with models of people who have learned to be “rich toward God”, whose life is so much more than “the abundance of possessions”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Two, it reminds us that we must all deal with death, that life is fatal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And, if we begin to deal with death, we just might begin to deal with God, with eternity, with true security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Four practical steps</strong> toward being “rich toward God”:<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Develop a rich prayer life</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Resolve to take a small step to expand your prayer life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For the past few years, I have worked to expand my prayer life in some simple way every year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Simple is key.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There’s no sense in booking a guilt trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps you will resolve to pray for people when you wait in line at the grocery store or the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Or pray for your children every night as you brush your teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Or set aside a block of time weekly, or smaller chunks daily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Take one step at a time.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Give thanks</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is interesting that the rich man of the story never acknowledges God or the people who have made his success possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When we succeed on a grand scale, when we achieve our dreams, there are always people who have made a difference and there are always a few instances where – despite all our work to control the outcome – the ball simply bounced our way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Despite this, the man never gives thanks to God and certainly doesn’t offer bonuses to his staff.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pour yourself into other people</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is implied in the question to the rich man, about to die: “The things you have prepared, whose will they be?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>People are eternal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Stuff passes away, ending up in a garbage pile or archaeological dig, and what is still around when we die doesn’t come with us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Invest in people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Go out to lunch with a friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Bake cookies for the new neighbors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Volunteer at the school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Visit some of our older adults.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Give</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We have enough not by having more but by giving more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>By orientation I am miserly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Building bigger barns?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I totally get it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I pinch pennies, save all I can, but no matter how abundant my savings I still sense scarcity rather than “the abundance of possessions”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know about you, but my barns aren’t big enough yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Scripture teaches us that it is generosity that releases abundance in our lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Not that giving leads to having more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It actually leads to having less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But once you figure out that you don’t need more, you suddenly find that you have more than enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Generosity – and Robin – broke me from my dependance on more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In my case, tithing wasn’t, and isn’t, enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We had to give away more – cars, a dining room suite – good stuff, not junk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And it breaks me of my addiction to stuff, helps me live in the abundance, the richness of all that we have been given.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Warren Buffet quotes, <i>Kiplinger’s Personal Finance,</i>11/2013, p 32.</span><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lloyd Reeb, 2004 uncorrected proof, <i>From Success to Significance: When the Pursuit of Success Isn’t Enough,</i> Zondervan: <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Grand Rapids</st1:place></st1:city>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph A.
