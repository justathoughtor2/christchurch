In the film, a rather bombastic character named Vizzini the Sicilian has the bothersome habit of repeatedly – and usually inappropriately – using a particular word. Whenever he is confronted by an opinion with which he disagrees, or by a possibility he thinks too improbable to entertain, or by the very suggestion that another person might be his intellectual equal, he declares – emphatically and </span><i><span style="line-height: 150%;">always</span></i><span style="line-height: 150%;">annoyingly – “inconceivable!” In the scene in question, after yet another of Vizzini’s outbursts, one of his traveling companions, a laconic mercenary named Inigo Montoya, looks at him and says, in a low voice tinged ever so slightly with sarcasm, “You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Well, “that word,” in today’s text – and for that matter in all of Leviticus (it appears there more than in any other book of the bible) – is “holy.” It is a word we think we understand, and are pretty sure we don’t much care for. Perhaps because we are burdened by our common inheritance from those wacky Puritans, or because of our exposure to a certain brand of fundamentalism, or perhaps just because we have all been acculturated to a world that is anything <i>but </i>holy, many of us would just as soon stay as far from holiness as we possibly can. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It’s not that holiness frightens us so much as it depresses and annoys us. Holy people have withdrawn from the world into little cocoons of religiousness and abandoned the quest for the good life. They seem, or so we think, to have no joy, and what’s worse, they are killjoys. They hate their bodies and think sex is dirty and avoid it except maybe as an occasional evil necessary for the propagation of presumably holy children. They don’t care for good food and drink – neither wine nor beer nor bourbon ever passes their lips – and seem to live on bread and water if they eat at all. And don’t even get me started on the religiosity – all the inane “God bless yous,” the pious dismissals of the realities of pain and suffering, and the endless string of Bible verses they seem to have prepared for every occasion. Who in his or her right mind would want to be like that? Who, given the choice, wants to be holy? Or so we imagine…<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">But, as Inigo Montoya might remind us, &nbsp;“that word” does not mean what we think it means. Holiness, properly understood, has only the most tangential of connections to the attitudes and behaviors I just named.&nbsp; Holiness is gospel – not just good news, but <i>really</i> good news – and it is indispensable both to our flourishing and to the healing of God’s good Creation.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><b><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">II.<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Our first mistake with respect to holiness is our tendency to associate it with piety or religiosity. We equate these things with holiness and assume it demands from us some form of cloistered life, separated from the world of work and play and family and devoted to nothing but praying and Bible reading. We think it means having all the answers to mysteries like the suffering of children or natural disasters that kill thousands or genocidal massacres perpetrated by one ethnic group against another. Make no mistake about it, prayer and knowledge of scripture are important elements of a faithful life, one <i>oriented toward</i> holiness, and from time to time a wise person steeped in these activities may indeed have some insight into the difficulties of living as broken creatures in a broken Creation. But in themselves, these things are not holiness.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 150%;">Holiness, at least as it is understood in Leviticus and the rest of the First Testament, has considerably less to do with the explicitly religious life and more to do with the quotidian, or everyday life. The holy life is the life of community and household and family, the life of farming and commerce, the life of lovemaking and raising children, the life of eating and drinking. To some extent, at least, the holy life is less about <i>what</i> one does than <i>how </i>one does it. </span><span style="line-height: 150%;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 150%;">The Hebrew word translated “holy” is <i>q<sup>a</sup>dōsh. Q<sup>a</sup>dōsh </i>is an ancient word with roots in other languages predating Hebrew by many hundreds of years. As such, it carries a richness of meaning that is sometimes overlooked or unappreciated. Its most basic meaning with reference to humankind derives from its primary sense as an attribute of the God of Israel; the L</span><span style="line-height: 150%;">ORD</span><span style="line-height: 150%;"> is <i>q<sup>a</sup>dōsh</i>, for the L</span><span style="line-height: 150%;">ORD</span><span style="line-height: 150%;"> is one – not simply in number, but in quality; absolutely unique and incomparable, radically distinct from the Creation he has lovingly spoken into existence. The great 20<sup>th</sup>century Protestant theologian Karl Barth spoke of an “infinite qualitative distinction” between God and Creation. In this sense, God alone is <i>q<sup>a</sup>dōsh</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 150%;">But if God alone is <i>q<sup>a</sup>dōsh</i>, then what does it mean when God calls <i>his people </i>to be<i> </i>holy because <i>he </i>is holy? Well, with respect to God’s people, their being <i>q<sup>a</sup>dōsh </i>refers first of all to their being <i>set apart </i>from the other peoples and those peoples’ gods to be <i>the L</i></span><i><span style="line-height: 150%;">ORD</span></i><i><span style="line-height: 150%;">’s people. </span></i><span style="line-height: 150%;">To be holy is to <i>be different</i>; it is to conduct one’s affairs in a way differently than is typical among those who have not yet been made part of God’s people. It is important to understand at this point that the call to be holy is a call not to an individual or a collection of individuals, but to a <i>community</i>, specifically the community to whom God revealed himself by name (i.e., as “the L</span><span style="line-height: 150%;">ORD,” </span><span style="line-height: 150%;">which is in the First Testament a circumlocution for the divine name).<i> </i>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the people who came to be called Israel, were called by God to be a people, to enter into a form of communal life whereby the way they lived together and treated one another would be a declaration to the other peoples of the world of God’s ultimate intention for <i>all</i>Creation. Holiness, in this sense, is in part the fulfillment of God’s assurance to Abraham that through his descendants, “all the peoples of the world [would] be blessed.”<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 150%;">And this brings us to a second meaning of <i>q<sup>a</sup>dōsh</i>, one implicit in the Hebrew but more evident in our English word “holy.”&nbsp; The English word holy, you see, is part of an ancient linguistic family that includes the words whole, wholesome, heal, health, and healthy. To be holy is to be whole, to have a kind of integrity of life that sets this people apart from the alienation and self-interestedness characteristic of the broken world. It makes a certain sense that the law God gives to Israel and us is neither capricious nor arbitrary, but </span><i><span style="line-height: 150%;">directed toward our flourishing as a people</span></i><span style="line-height: 150%;">. God has given, not just to </span><i><span style="line-height: 150%;">his</span></i><span style="line-height: 150%;"> people but to <i>all</i>people the abundant goods of Creation, asking only that we use them responsibly, respectfully, and generously. In a world characterized by the sicknesses of hatred, violence, injustice, greed, and exploitation, a people whose uses of Creation reject those ways of being cannot help embracing and embodying a decidedly more wholesome alternative.&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height: 150%;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><b><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">III.<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">All of which is to say that the holiness codes of Leviticus are extremely <i>practical</i>, as the verses we read a moment ago indicate. A people holy to God must respect, listen to, and care for the elderly among them. They must preserve the implicit covenant among the generations, caring for their elders even when it is inconvenient or costly, knowing that the wisdom and memory of those women and men are indispensible to maintaining the integrity of the community and its distinctiveness as belonging to God. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 150%;">A people holy to God must devote themselves to serving the poor in their midst, avoiding every appearance of exploiting them and making sure that they have an share of the goods of Creation sufficient to make possible their flourishing. They must show hospitality to the aliens and strangers among them, treating them like kin and remembering that their own existence as a free people with a land of their own was God’s doing, and not theirs, for it was the L</span><span style="line-height: 150%;">ORD</span><span style="line-height: 150%;"> who delivered them from bondage in Egypt and gave them a law to shape their common life.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">A people holy to God must be a truthful people who deal fairly with each other and always have each others’ backs. Neighbors must act lovingly toward one another, avoiding every hint of violence and seeking each other’s good, rather than their own advantage. Employers must deal fairly with their workers and give them a good wage.&nbsp; Merchants must deal honestly with their customers, charging fair prices and using honest weights and measures. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And perhaps most important of all, a people holy to God must live ever mindful that their lives and everything about them are gifts from God. As such, they must treat the Creation from which they draw their life with respect and gratitude, remembering that it is God’s, not theirs, and that it has purposes beyond those to which they might put it. They must assure that no one in their membership becomes so desperately poor that they are at risk of losing their dignity or doing without the goods of creation they need, and that no one becomes so outrageously wealthy that they are tempted to think of themselves as “self-made” or in any way better than others, or that their wealth becomes an occasion for envy within the community.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><b><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IV.<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It is vital that we keep in mind that our consideration of Leviticus is far more than an academic exercise, for the call for God’s people to be holy has never been revoked. We, as followers of Jesus and members of his body by baptism are called to be holy; not to be perfect nor pious, but to live our lives together in such a way that we serve and encourage each other and present to those beyond our membership a glimpse of a better, more wholesome way of life, the way of life for which we <i>and </i>they have been made.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">But where do we start? If we indeed want to be a holy people – a <i>whole </i>people – how do we go about it? We have an outline, not only in today’s text, but throughout scripture, but what do the words written there have to do with us, and how do we put them into practice? <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Beyond the obvious answers to that question – showing up for church and investing ourselves in fulfilling our membership vows, participating in the community closet and action church and open table – one thing seems to me especially important. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, spoke of “Christian conferencing” as being among what he called the “instituted means of grace.” He believed that regularly gathering with one another for honest conversation about the most practical matters of life – how we make and spend money; how we conduct ourselves at work, in our households, and in our marriages; how we understand and use the goods of creation; and how we interact with the most vulnerable members of our society – would serve to strengthen and encourage us in the pursuit of holiness. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Our world is very different from the world of Leviticus (or, for that matter, from the world of John Wesley), most pointedly in the excessive value we give to individualism. But unless we dare to meet and be truthful with each other, asking and answering difficult questions and sharing both encouragement and gentle correction, we are not likely fully to become the kind of community God has called us to be. And as long as there exists in our society a “people-of-God-shaped-hole,” evils like racism and other bigotries, injustice toward the poor, legal corruption, and ecological destruction will persist and grow stronger. The world we inhabit needs us to be a holy people. It need us to show what an abundant and joyful thing holiness is – to show, if you will, that holiness “does not mean what [they] think it means.”<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">God has given us the means to become that people and promised to be with us along the way. It’s good work, and it’s a great gift, and we ought to get started. Thanks be to God.</span><span style="font-family: Arial Narrow, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div>
