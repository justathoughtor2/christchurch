(Thanks, Joel, for bringing the word while I was away. Sorry, all, for the lack of video.)&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">“There are two ways, one of life and one of death, and there is a great difference between the two ways.” So begins the ancient Christian text called the <i>Didachē</i>, or “The Teaching of the Twelve,” produced sometime around the end of the first century—making it older, incidentally, than several New Testament texts. I won’t offer many details about this ancient catechetical document, other than to say it places the way of Jesus—his life, teachings, death and resurrection—and the difference those events make in stark contrast with business-as-usual in a world characterized by a profound brokenness manifest in unfettered self-interest and the isolation and violence it inevitably entails. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">That first line from the <i>Didachē </i>brings to my mind<i> </i>another more contemporary text contrasting two distinct ways (of life). It is the poem “Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front,” written by Wendell Berry, whom I regard as being among my most important mentors. It begins this way:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="line-height: 115%; margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Love the quick profit, the annual raise,<br />vacation with pay. Want more<br />of everything ready-made. Be afraid<br />to know your neighbors and to die.<br />And you will have a window in your head.<br />Not even your future will be a mystery<br />any more. Your mind will be punched in a card<br />and shut away in a little drawer.<br />When they want you to buy something<br />they will call you. When they want you<br />to die for profit they will let you know.</span></i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;"></span></div><a name='more'></a>This first stanza pretty well sums up what the <i>Didachē</i> calls the way of death. It depicts a life <i>dominated by fear</i>—frantic, worried, selfish, and utterly predictable, cradle to grave. It is a life shaped by the assumption that we live in a world of profound scarcity, which in turn leads us to hold our possessions tightly; to see others as competition for scarce resources, or as resources themselves, to be exploited for our pleasure, or worst of all as enemies to be avoided or imprisoned or if necessary killed. It is a life pointed squarely toward uncritical lockstep membership in the church of Mammon; a life that isn’t really life at all, but rather what the twentieth century novelist Walker Percy called “the living death… death in the name of isms and asms… enthusiasm, liberalism, conservatism, Communism, Buddhism, Americanism, for an ism is only another way of despairing of the truth.”<o:p></o:p><br /><div style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">As women and men united through baptism to the death and resurrection of Jesus, we do not <i>need</i>to despair of the truth. We do not need to continue in captivity to the living death, for by God’s grace we can <i>know</i>the truth, and by that same grace we can <i>live</i>it. The truth is, as one of my favorite preachers says, that the God we gather here to worship doesn’t leave dead things dead. The truth is, as we declared to each other when we gathered this morning, that Christ is risen. God’s extravagantly generous reign has broken into history, and the power of death—living and otherwise—is broken, now and forever. Christ is risen, and that changes, or should change, everything—everything about the way we think, and everything about the way we live, for we are now free to follow the <i>Didachē’s </i>first way, the way of life.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">But just what does this “way of life” look like? One of this week’s lectionary texts, from the fourth chapter of the book of Acts, gives us a particularly clear instance. It is a story of the members of the Church in Jerusalem during the days following the resurrection. The author of Acts, Paul’s friend Luke, clearly wants his readers to understand that community’s life together as an example to be followed, if not in letter, then at the very least in spirit and practice. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Perhaps the best one-word description of the community depicted in this text is “fearless.” They had witnessed the irruption of the kingdom of God into the brokenness of the world and had been utterly transformed by that experience. Selfishness, greed, and wariness of the other were nowhere to be found among them, for they had become a people whose entire life together was devoted to showing the world that because Christ was risen and the power of death broken, a <i>different</i>way, the way of <i>life</i> was now possible. This conviction so unified them that they are described as being “of one heart and soul,” and their singleness of purpose was displayed above all in their fearless generosity. The word “mine” had been purged from their vocabulary, and replaced by “ours”—or perhaps it would be better to say “God’s.” The notion of private property, so essentially dear to us, had become to them an absurdity, for they understood that everything they had, including and perhaps especially their lives, was pure gift, given not to be hoarded or wasted, but used and shared.&nbsp; The very idea that a sister or brother should be allowed to continue in need of an adequate share of the goods of Creation—to go hungry or naked or homeless or alone—when others among them had more than enough was to them <i>anathema</i>, and so they freely shared <i>all</i> they had. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">The Resurrection, you see, had made possible a new kind of human community, the fearlessness of which was not based in any sort of reckless disregard for life or any private, quasi-mystical, “God will provide” piety. Rather, this community’s fearlessness came from its members’ love for and trust in God and one another, from their knowledge that no matter what misfortune might befall any one of them, there were sisters and brothers who had their back, and who could be counted upon to care for them and provide for their needs. They were a people who fully embodied Paul’s description of the “body of Christ” in 1 Corinthians 12, for they believed entirely that “God [had] so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member, that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">As countercultural and counterintuitive as all this sounds, it’s important to note that we here at Christ church are not absolute strangers to it. We have in our midst women and men who are striving to live out their resurrection faith—people like Lee and Shirley Wetzel, who for years have given of their time and resources to serve the poor in our community through the work of the local food bank; or Joanne Hagner, who has been, as they say, “all in” by investing deeply in the lives of our youth and modeling for them the service characteristic of those who take the Resurrection seriously; or Mike Case and the Care Team he leads, who take time to give themselves to the sickest and loneliest among us. There are others, to be sure, but those folks in particular stand out in my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 200%;">Luke invites all of us, every one of whom share with those first believers the same faith, Spirit, and baptism that made them who they were, the opportunity to share as well in their fearlessness. There is nothing glib in this invitation; the world we inhabit is no less scary today than it was in Roman-occupied first century Palestine. How, then, do we start? How do <i>we </i>become an “Easter people”? There are no easy answers to that question, but perhaps there is some wisdom about it to be gleaned from some of the remaining lines of the poem I began reading a few minutes earlier, where the writer describes what for him, at least, is the “way of life”:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 115%; margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">So, friends, every day do something<br />that won't compute. Love the Lord.<br />Love the world. Work for nothing.<br />Take all that you have and be poor.<br />Love someone who does not deserve it…<o:p></o:p></span></i></div><div style="line-height: 115%; margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Give your approval to all you cannot<br />understand. Praise ignorance, for what man<br />has not encountered he has not destroyed…<o:p></o:p></span></i></div><div style="line-height: 115%; margin-left: .5in;"><i><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As soon as the generals and the politicos<br />can predict the motions of your mind,<br />lose it. Leave it as a sign<br />to mark the false trail, the way<br />you didn't go. Be like the fox<br />who makes more tracks than necessary,<br />some in the wrong direction.<br />Practice resurrection.<o:p></o:p></span></i></div><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">Practice resurrection. When all else is said and done, that <i>is</i> the Christian life: coming together every week to hear the story told and see it embodied and enacted in bread and cup; encouraging and sometimes even admonishing each other to “press on,” as Paul said, “toward the goal for the prize of the high call of God in Christ Jesus”; offering each other in the peace we exchange every week the assurance that whatever happens to you, whatever needs you have, I will be there for you; slowly and painstakingly being transformed by grace, delivered from the fear that makes us say “mine” of the gifts we have been given. Whether we know it or not, and sometimes in spite of all appearances to the contrary, God is at work in our midst, turning us into Easter people. Thanks be to God.</span>
