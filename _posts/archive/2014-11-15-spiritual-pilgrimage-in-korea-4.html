<span style="font-family: inherit;">From our District Superintendent, Rev. Dr. Tom Salsgiver:</span><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">One of the similarities of the South Korean culture and the American culture is how busy people are.&nbsp; Talking with pastors we heard similar stories like we here in the US about how over-extended people are.&nbsp; Education is so highly valued in South Korea that there is great competition for tutors for the best classes.&nbsp; The graduation rate for High School in South Korea is about 90%.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In addition to the demand for study, most children and youth take music lessons of some kind, sports, physical fitness, martial arts.&nbsp; Over and over we heard and saw examples of how busy people are.&nbsp; We were told that often students with the amount of time they put into studying,&nbsp; extra-curricular activities, and church they often get only 6 hours sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I am not lifting this up as healthy—but setting the stage for what we in the US churches hear all the time—“my kids and I are so busy we don’t have time to do anything at church.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Not so in the churches we visited.&nbsp; Bupyeong Church where we stayed told us about how they train lay people as small group leaders and volunteers.&nbsp; The church does most of its ministry with volunteers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In our culture where it becomes very difficult to find a volunteer to sit in the nursery, or serve on a committee, or spend 3 hours a week caring for the outside of the church, we saw a completely different understanding of church involvement.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In Bupyeong Church EVERY Saturday 40-50 come to clean the church.&nbsp; All during the week we marveled at how clean this large building was.&nbsp; It is these 50 people’s commitment to clean so that church money can go for mission and ministry.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Every week 8 people buy the flowers and come together to arrange them and put them throughout the church.&nbsp; The arrangements while we were there were unique and lovingly done not by a florist someone paid—but by church members.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span></div><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: inherit;">The guest house we stayed in (which was motel accommodations) were cleaned every day, sheets changed, clean towels put in the bathrooms and new snacks everyday on the table in each room.&nbsp; This is accomplished by 20 people whose ministry it is to come in and clean.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Because many people come for the entire day on Sunday, there are 20-30 volunteers who work in the dining room, providing dinner, snacks and refreshments for choir members, teachers, and others who spend the entire day at the church.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are 20 people whose ministry it is every week to serve as traffic control for people to find and get parking places.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I noticed both on Sunday and during the early morning prayer services that the ushers did not stand around and talk with each other.&nbsp; They personally greeted worshippers and in most instances escorted them to their seats.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The pastor told us that those involved in children’s ministry are so committed to getting children to church on Sunday that their family will often buy a van to be able to transport kids who have no transportation to church.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pastor Hong told us that most all of the volunteers use their own money for the ministry so that their tithes go for mission and ministry beyond what they do.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It was incredible to hear and witness the incredible generosity of money—but also time and energy these Christians, on fire for Christ, give to their church—and to the Kingdom of God.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It’s been 1 month since we landed in Seoul and met the people of the Bupyeong Church.&nbsp; I continue to marvel at their commitment and the movement of God’s spirit in the lives of the church people, and especially in the lives of the unchurched people in South Korea.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">My prayer is that that fervor, that dedication, and that commitment would take hold in the Lewisburg District and in the lives of people who call themselves United Methodist Christians.</span><o:p></o:p></div>
