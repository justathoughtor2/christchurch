There are so many hot button, tough topics in our culture that all come together under the heading of “human life”: capital punishment, abortion, euthanasia, letting die, suicide, war. And, so many of the ways we talk about these issues are mapped and shaped by our culture rather than the Bible and the theological resources of the Christian tradition. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you find yourself comfortable in the cultural left, with the general suspicion of war, the desire to abolish the death penalty, and a passion to protect the reproductive rights of women, you speak powerfully about the value of human life, and refer to Scripture while doing so, and perhaps not recognize the potential conflict in the practice of abortion. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you find yourself part of the cultural right, you may find yourself quoting Scripture on the value of human life, particularly the life of the unborn, and quoting Scripture in support of the death penalty, without paying attention to the ways one position undercuts the other. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the American church, most Protestants find themselves in one of these camps. On the other hand, both the official statements of The United Methodist Church and the Catholic Church are consistently pro-life, on both abortion and the death penalty, on euthanasia and suicide. Pope John Paul II published a beautifully written encyclical titled <i>The Gospel of Life,</i> in which he addressed the multi-faceted “life issue” and also tenderly addressed women who have had abortions, reminding them that the grace and mercy of God is for them as well: “Do not give in to discouragement and do not lose hope. … Nothing is definitively lost” (177-178).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In The Social Principles, we recognize the “tragic conflicts of life with life” and therefore acknowledge that abortion may be appropriate in protecting the life of the mother. Whenever we talk about the value of human life, whatever specific issue we are debating, what we are talking about is how to address these “tragic conflicts”. We may discuss other matters as well – the disproportionate number of poor and minority persons given the death penalty, the impact of mental health on suicide, what it means to say “every child a wanted child”, and post-traumatic stress – but these are all terms that revolve around specific and tragic conflicts of life with life.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">An abused child asks his safe parent about suicide: Is it the unpardonable sin? A mom finds her young adult son dead by suicide and asks about the fate of his eternal soul. A woman tells me that she can’t be forgiven, because she has had an abortion. Another woman declares that she’ll be brutally beaten or kicked out of her home if she doesn’t have an abortion. A friend kills a man in a bar fight. A young man is behind the wheel when he loses control of the car and his best friend, in the passenger seat, is killed. To all, I say that nothing we do is beyond redemption or beyond hope.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An aging person says that they don’t want to be a burden to their children. While it is a good thing to be able to plan ahead for a future when we cannot fully care for ourselves, no human life is a burden. An older person with advanced dementia, a young person with developmental disabilities, an infant with a normal brain who simply isn’t old enough to explain why he is crying. We are not burdens. We are family. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ellen” grew up with the knowledge that she was an unwanted child. Mom said that she should have aborted her. Her relationship with her parents was always tense, and she overcompensated with her children, struggling to set limits because she wanted them, and wanted them to feel wanted. Her last child was from an unplanned pregnancy to a man who wanted no commitment. She kept her child, determined to want her child, and now found her already limited financial resources stretched to the breaking point.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A police officer on a tactical team has the authorization to shoot, has the armed perpetrator in his sights, and yet does not pull the trigger. At that moment, he is putting his entire squad and the larger team at risk, all on the hunch that they may be able to apprehend the man without additional violence. It turned out that he was both right about the outcome and right to make the decision, but it was still a risky decision – a conflict of life with life.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I pray for our men and women in uniform, one of the things I pray is for God to safeguard their souls. Post-traumatic stress is not simply the result of what happens to you. It can also be experienced because of what you do, even what you do under orders or what you do in self-defense. We recognize those exceptional kinds of life-with-life conflicts, and yet they can still do huge damage to our souls.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Today’s Scripture is chosen, not because it clarifies the “life issues” of our time. It doesn’t. There are no references to how God knows us in the womb, to what it means to have a good death, to mercy or judgment for capital offenses. Just one more story not fit for Sunday School, but a story that exposes the conflicted zone in which we all live. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jephthah is the son of a prostitute. He was driven from his family and people by his father’s “legitimate” sons. He became an outlaw and the leader of a large group of raiders. So, when his own people needed a deliverer from the power of the Ammonites, they thought of … who else? The guy who had a reputation as an effective and fearless killer. There were a few issues to negotiate before he takes them up on their offer. Jephthah then negotiated with the king of Ammon, but Jephthah’s reputation was not enough to make the enemy back down. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time for words was over; it was time for battle. And we get this remarkable phrase, “The spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah” (Judges 11.29). He’s never been viewed as a saint. He’s got far too much baggage and never seemed concerned about it. God used him anyway. That’s all wonderful. It is nice to be reminded that God can and does use total rascals. But then he makes what has to be one of the stupidest vows in history: “Whoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the LORD’s, to be offered up by me as a burnt offering” (11.31). It makes a little sense when we remember that Jephthah is a warlord accustomed to getting his way by force or bribery, and this sounds like an attempt to bribe God. In many ways, that’s us, isn’t it? We succeed because we are good at what we do, because we have leverage in crucial relationships (hopefully not the leverage of bribery), because we are talented, because of who we know.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, maybe it makes a <i>little</i> sense, but it is still nuts, on two counts. First, the vague “whoever” or “whatever” makes no distinction between a human and the livestock that lived in the same house in that era. Second, the very idea that God is bribable. And the text makes no comment on it at all, as if the text itself is entirely unaware of how crazy a story it is telling or is too shocked to do anything other than report the details. When Jephthah’s daughter meets him, he accuses her: “You have become the cause of great trouble to me” (11.35). Talk about blaming the victim! Yet, she is not only submissive but also unfailingly kind. And, when it comes to what Jephthah actually does to his daughter, to fulfill his vow, no details are given. Some scholars have concluded that he did not sacrifice his daughter, only committed her to a celibate life. I do not find that reading convincing. Instead, I think that this where the text is aware of itself. Such a story, such a detail, is better left untold.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conflicted story of Jephthah: He is blessed and given success by the Spirit of the LORD, but still lives as if it all depends on his ability to negotiate, bribe, or overpower. He loves his daughter, but he loves his honor more. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Why was he, despite his grief, still willing to kill his daughter? I don’t think it is just because of his honor. I think it is something else: He had already become a killer. Who we are is a huge component of what we do. And, what we do – which, for Jephthah, was killing people in raids and in war –what we do has a huge impact in making us who we are.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so much easier to take a life when we’ve already got blood on our hands. Remember Lady Macbeth? “Out damned spot!” Jephthah has become a killer. News flash: We’ve all got blood on our hands. One way or another, we’re all guilty.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Why was he, despite his grief, still willing to kill his daughter? He had already become a killer. Who do we want to become? What kind of actions will help us become that kind of person?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frederick Bauerschmidt poses this insightful question in an article on abortion and Christian ethics. He notes the history of the abortion debate as one of competing rights – the “right to life” of the fetus or child and the woman’s right to “control … her own body” (290). With our passionate American insistence that we all have the “right” to our own opinion, no real progress in the debate is made (291). Instead, Bauerschmidt points out, “Moral questions are not simply questions of what one should <i>do,</i> but also questions of who one should <i>be”</i> (292). He does not want us to miss the “impact of the action on the agent” (292).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It reminds me of Paul’s use of the same kind of reasoning when writing the Corinthians about sexual immorality, in this case the patronization of prostitutes. (Just in case you are wondering, Christians were never and still are not perfect in every way!) Paul talked about the question as one that involves the human body (just like the moral questions around human life), and, in particular, the way our bodies are joined to Jesus as “members” of his body and in the hope of resurrection. “The body is meant for the Lord, and the Lord for the body” (1 Corinthians 6.13). “All things are permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial” (6.12). For a body that is designed to be united with Christ, a body that anticipates the joy of resurrection, we need to focus on what is beneficial to that union and to that hope, that is, on what kind of person do we wish to become?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Bauerschmidt proposes another Bible story as an example and answer to this question of what we want to become. It does not answer, at least not directly, the question of what we should do, certainly not the question of what we should do in terms of public policy. But instead of addressing the “what is permissible?” question that Paul makes clear is entirely inadequate, the story addresses a more profound question: “Who is my neighbor?” (Luke 10.29; Baurschmidt, 300-302). We shared this story with the children. Bauerschmidt suggests that “the moral achievement of the Samaritan was not the [noble] decision to help the wounded stranger”, even to do so across the barriers of race and religion, “but the ability to recognize that he had no choice but to help this wounded and vulnerable one” (301). It is about who he has become.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, that’s who I want to be – a lover of my neighbor, even if the neighbor is strange, even if the neighbor is an enemy. I want to act on that love reflexively, not because I am good or noble, but because “the love of Christ urges [me] on” (2 Corinthians 5.14). Whether that neighbor is Jimmy, 15 years older than me, with Downs Syndrome, whose favorite phrase is “I wanna Coke”; or Earl Clanton, who was executed on Virginia’s death row in 1988 for a gruesome $8 robbery and murder, whom I had the privilege to meet, and who wrote to me about how he had become reconciled to God; or a combative and demented old lady who landed her best left hook on my cheek while I was praying for her (that could be me someday); or even my own children when they drive me nuts. If I practice loving my neighbor, I will live out the value of human life instead of arguing over it.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The Bible gives us two great deliverance stories. The first is Israel’s deliverance from Egypt. It is a story that begins with infanticide, genocide, and human slavery. The second is the story of Jesus coming to deliver the entire human race. It is a story that begins with infanticide – all the children two years old and younger in Bethlehem and its surrounding villages killed by an insecure and power-hungry king. And it is a story that reaches its climax with the death penalty – Jesus hung on a cross to die. John Paul II remarks, “Truly great must be the value of human life if the Son of God has taken it up and made it the instrument of the salvation of all humanity” (60). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is great, so great that the “damned spot”, the blood on our hands, is washed clean once and for all. So great that nothing we do is beyond redemption or beyond hope. So great that we can become the people God has made us to be – lovers of God and lovers of our neighbors.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope John Paul II. 1995. <i>The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae): The encyclical letter on abortion, euthanasia, and the death penalty in today’s world.</i> New York: Random House.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt. 2011. “Being Baptized: Bodies and Abortion.” Chapter 22 in <i>The Blackwell Companion to Christian Ethics, </i>2<sup>nd</sup>edition, edited by Stanley Hauerwas and Samuel Wells.
