<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/find-resources/newsletters/global-health/2015/novemberissue2"><img alt="Pregnant women and children under age five receive nets in Mutum Biyu village, Taraba State, Nigeria October 2015." height="225" src="http://www.umcmission.org/images/UserUploadedImages/449/mutumbiyuvillage400.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;">Four countries, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, and Uganda account for nearly 50 percent of deaths due to malaria (from CDC and USAID reports, 2013). Nigeria is the worst hit with more reported malaria cases and deaths than any country in the world. With a population of about 170 million, many rural and hard to reach villages are often left out of national malaria control efforts. These remote and forgotten villages have been the focus of the Rural Health program of the United Methodist Church in Nigeria. The Nigerian Health Board has been responding to the challenge of malaria in remote villages tucked in the nooks of the Sandstone Mountains of North Eastern Nigeria along the banks of the Upper Benue River and stretching across Federated States of Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, and Adamawa States.&nbsp;</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">The aim of the Rural Health program is to reach the most vulnerable, pregnant women and children under age five with long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), malaria diagnosis, and treatment services in these underserved villages. Services are provided through two mobile clinics supported by the Imagine No Malaria grants from the General Board of Global Ministries. The first phase of bed net distribution in 2014 reached 3,400 women in 10 villages. The second phase in 2015 is targeted will reach 15,000 pregnant and nursing mothers in 30 villages. The health board hopes to reach even more villages with nets and services in 2016. Your gifts to the Imagine No Malaria program have given hope to children who might otherwise not make it to their 5th birthday. With your continued support we can do more in Nigeria in 2016.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;"><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/find-resources/newsletters/global-health/2015/novemberissue2">Read more stories from the Global Health newsletter.</a></span></span></div><br />
