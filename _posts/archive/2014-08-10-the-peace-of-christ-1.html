Now, he could simply be addressing their fear – how many here would feel comfortable speaking with a recently dead person? Theologically, however, he is also addressing their sin, the sin that lies between them, the sin that has created a breach, a gulf, a distance, in their relationship. These men turned their backs on Jesus, denied knowing him, disappeared into the night at the point of Jesus’ greatest personal need.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We ignore this dimension of the story because we are so fixed on an image of Jesus as a nice person, a good person. He is both nice and good. He has also proven himself adept at the exercise of power, effective at channeling his anger with great force. Now, he’s back from the dead and – if this was a horror flick – he’d have a score to settle with his old crew. Instead: “Peace be with you.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So, it’s not a horror flick, and I am not suggesting that the disciples were horrified to see Jesus. They knew he loved them, no matter what they had done. At the same time, they were so glad to know that they did not have to deal with that huge elephant: We let you down, we abandoned you, we failed. We can’t look ourselves in the mirror. How shall we ever look you in the eye? “Peace be with you.” “Repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed” (Luke 24.47). So, they were able to move all the more quickly to joy. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal">David to Solomon – settle the scores </div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Kings 2.1-10; Joab, Shimei; Barzillai</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honor-shame society … revenge killings</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">1 Kings 2:5, Joab of Abner and Amasa: “he murdered, retaliating in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war”</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t get mad.
