We open the series today with the question of diversity and unity and we will close with an examination of judgment. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all these, my purpose is to make certain you walk out of here thinking exactly like me, because I am right. Ha! Do you have any opinions that you think are wrong? If so, then they aren’t your opinions! John Wesley had some wisdom on this in his sermon on unity and diversity, and I have included the quote on your note sheet:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">Every man necessarily believes that every particular opinion which he holds is true . . . . He knows, in the general, that he himself is mistaken; although in what particulars he mistakes, he does not, perhaps he cannot, know (I.4, p 445).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">That is, on any specific matter for debate, if we hold an opinion and are not simply undecided, we think we are right. We know that we are not right about everything, but we have no way of identifying the specific ways we are wrong. Therefore, no, my purpose is not to persuade you to think like me. Nor is my purpose to provide a comprehensive summary on any of these issues. Others are more capable and gifted to do that work. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My purpose is to expand our imagination, to guide us to search our own souls, to open us to ambiguity not only in the heartbreaking stories that we can find throughout our society but especially in the weird and unsettling words of Scripture. In this regard, and particularly with this issue of diversity and unity, John Wesley shows the way. Over 250 years ago, well ahead of the postmodern obsession with ambiguity and narrative, John Wesley cherry-picked the strangest odd couple in the Bible and one of the most violent chapters in the entire book as the text for his message “Catholic Spirit”, which teaches us how to acknowledge our differences and still acknowledge what is universal in the church. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Let’s take a look at the characters. The stand-out character is Jehu, who is in the process of completing a violent coup. In the prior chapter, he killed Joram, the king of Israel, his cousin Ahaziah, the king of Judah, and the queen mother, Jezebel. In this chapter alone, the 70 male heirs to Israel’s throne are decapitated, 42 members of Judah’s royal family are slaughtered, the rest of Israel’s royal family are wiped out, and every Baal prophet and worshiper in Israel is killed. Jehu describes himself as “zealous” for the Lord (10.16), but one wonders how much of that zeal is really for his own power. Jehu, it seems, was wild with power, fueled by a barely controlled rage. He had a reputation even as a chariot driver. You could tell it was Jehu, a long way off, because “he drives like a maniac” (2Ki 9.20). The expression has fallen out of common usage, but we used to talk about crazy road rage drivers and say that they were “driving like a Jehu”. All John Wesley says about Jehu as a person is that he was a “mixed character” (Intro.5, p 444)! Quite an understatement.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The supporting character in the story is Jehonadab son of Rechab. This passage tells us nothing about Jehonadab. We learn about him through the prophet Jeremiah, who 300 years later, met with Jehonadab’s descendants (Jer 35). Even then, many generations later, they were maintaining the unique spiritual practices of their ancestor. They refused to drink wine, they lived in tents rather than in cities or homes, they were almost monastic in their spiritual devotion. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man of action and a man of contemplation. A man of power and a man of self-denial. A man of the world and a man of worship. Yet the text tells us that Jehonadab “comes to meet” Jehu and that Jehu, when he sees Jehonadab, “greets” him. (The Hebrew term here for a greeting is also translated “kneel” and “bless.”) The indication is that Jehu greets Jehonadab in a manner that honors him and his devotion to God.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jehu asks this remarkable question: “Is your heart right (true, straight), as my heart is with your heart?” There is no discussion of the huge differences between the two men, only the question about the heart. And, if their hearts are “right” with one another, then Jehu has grounds to say, “Give me your hand” (2Ki 10.15).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">On the hard topics that we will discuss in the weeks ahead, the first question for us, in the language of John Wesley, is whether our hearts are right – right with God and right with each other. The first question is not whether our opinion is right. Undoubtedly, with as many opinions are represented in this room on any of these hard topics, we know that there must be a lot of wrong people here … just not me, okay? <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">There’s a New Testament odd couple in Jesus’ disciple band. We’re not given any information on how they interacted with each other, just enough detail to know that they had very little in common – except Jesus. Simon (not Simon Peter but the other Simon) was a Zealot. He was a member of a party that advocated overthrowing Roman occupation, even by force. Matthew was a tax collector … for the Roman occupational forces. Today, if we were to go to the same part of the world, that would be like putting a militant member of Hamas and a Palestinian who informed for Israel’s Mossad in the same group. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there’s a not-quite-as-odd-but-still-odd couple in the early history of German Methodism in America. Philip William Otterbein, a highly educated German Reformed preacher from the Old World, hears Martin Boehm, a Mennonite farmer without formal education from the New World, preaching at Long’s Barn in Lancaster County. After the service, he just has to meet him. They clasp hands and Otterbein declares, “We are brethren” – and their branch of Methodism became known as the United Brethren. “Behold how good and pleasant it is when brothers and sisters live together in unity” (Ps 133.1).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, can we live in unity and still be honest about the huge cultural, theological, and moral questions that divide us? Can a board member of Planned Parenthood and a volunteer coordinator for a pro-life crisis pregnancy center share the same pew? Can a literal reader of the Genesis creation account and an evolutionary biologist worship Jesus together? Can a gay couple and a straight couple gather to eat at the table of the Lord together? These are huge questions today, for which I only have a local answer: Yes. I’ve seen it happen. In the larger organizations, denominations are splitting over these questions, sometimes but not always peacefully, sometimes still recognizing in one another a brother or sister in Jesus. In our own conference, our bishop is calling the clergy to gather to pray and discuss with him questions around same-gender marriage, not because we all agree but because we must have these conversations if we are to follow Jesus together and remain a united church.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Wesley did not suggest that all followers of Jesus would end up in the same church. He felt that would violate the conscience of the individual and prevent the kinds of gifts that come to the church through reformation (I.10,11; pp 447-448). His conclusion: “My only question is this, ‘Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?’” (p 448).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Years ago, a colleague asked for the scoop on someone he was considering hiring. I had worked with this person in the past and he has become a dear friend. My colleague wanted to know if this friend of mine fit his theological categories and posed a liberal versus evangelical litmus test. I hated the question and replied instead, “He loves Jesus. He loves people. And he loves the Bible.” When I look to recruit people in the ministry of the church, these are the most important matters, far more important than opinions on the hard topics of our time. And, for me, if I fail in any of those areas it does not matter how effective I am in all the other professional measures: I will have failed both as a follower of Jesus and as a pastor.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Wesley felt the same way about what was most important. When he read Jehu’s question, he suggested that we ask what is “properly implied”, not what Jehu meant, since he is such a mixed character that we just cannot know his heart (I.12, p 448f). For Wesley, what is “properly implied” can be organized around the themes of our annual confirmation class: “Love God, love everyone.” Wesley asks, “May we not be of one heart, though not of one mind?” (Intro.4, p 444). “Behold how good and pleasant it is when brothers and sisters live together in unity” (Ps 133.1).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Note: John Wesley did not simply airbrush our differences and ask us all to “get along”. He decried a “speculative latitudinarianism” (quite a mouthful!) that looks a lot like modern relativism, naming it “the spawn of hell”. For him, there is no room for “what’s true for me is true for me; what’s true for you is true for you”. There is truth, and it is important for us to make up our minds about our convictions. From his perspective, the “catholic spirit”, has nothing to do with “muddy understanding, because your mind is all in a mist … [because you] are for jumbling all opinions together” (III.1, p 453).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disagree. Disagree vigorously. And, yes, disagree with me. And learn to recognize a brother or sister in the other. Love God. Love everyone. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>On your note sheet, I have a few assignments for you to consider:<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Pray for us as we have these conversations, to honor our differences and to stay focused on being united in the love of God. Pray that your heart will be open to discern a brother or sister in those with whom you disagree.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Read John Wesley’s sermon on diversity and unity, “Catholic Spirit”, available online at:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/sermons.v.xxxix.html#v.xxxix-p0.3">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/sermons.v.xxxix.html#v.xxxix-p0.3</a><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Read the stories of cultural conflict and resolution in the early church from Acts chapters 6, 10-11, and 15.
