God has been faithful and God’s people have been gracious. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Lisa and I would like to express our heart-felt appreciation for your warming hospitality, that we were privileged to receive, when we visited places throughout the conference.

This is the time and you are the one.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Fully knowing what it means to go to the king without prior permission, Esther replies, “I will go to the king, even though it is against the law.

Churches of our conference cannot be insulated from its effect. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;">Recently </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">same gender marriage has become legal in the common wealth of Pennsylvania. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Among the people in our church, as well as in the general public, this change of law certainly gives a reason for celebration for some, causes frustration for some, and raises confusion for some. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Church law remains the same.

The faithful disciples of Jesus Christ, who love and serve God with passion, devotion, and integrity, honestly have different biblical and theological beliefs and understandings of the issue. People on both sides are hurting and are in pain as brokenness and divisiveness over the issue continue to deepen and widen among our people. The way to build a bridge and keep the unity becomes ever more challenging. People in some circles have now begun to use words like amicable separation. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;">We see a dark cloud forming over the horizon in the shape of an S word: “schism”. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">God’s people, we are called to be a church for such a time as this.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Recently I read an article written by a young clergy of our conference in response to the emerging voices for schism. His plea was that it’s time to talk. It resonated deeply with me. When such an explosive topic as a schism in our connection over such a divisive issue as same gender marriage is brewing and spilling all over the place, simply to remain silent is not an option. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">When the brokenness hurts and harms people, it’s a time to talk. When the divisiveness threatens the unity and peace of the church, it’s a time to talk.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">When the foundation of our common covenant is in serious jeopardy, it’s a time to talk.

Let’s put our trust in the God who called us to be a church for such a time as this.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Today’s scripture readings are powerfully relevant to our current struggle: God’s people of the Susquehanna Conference, take heart! God is faithful! God who gives us endurance and encouragement is with us. Though we may go through the ordeal of disagreement, we do not lose a spirit of unity. Though we may not think alike, we follow one Lord, Jesus Christ. Though we may not believe exactly the same way, we glorify God with one heart and mouth. Though we may have differences, we accept one another as Christ accepts you and me. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Jesus reminds us that the world will know us as His disciples, not by taking certain biblical, theological, and doctrinal positions, but by our love for one another. Whatever position we may take, let the love arise and reach to the other side.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">That’s the witness we are called to give to the world for such a time as this.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">It is my hope and prayer that the world will say of us someday: “Look at those people called United Methodists. They have disagreements with one another. They show differences among them. But see how they still accept one another. Look, how they still love one another. They must be disciples of Jesus Christ!” By God’s grace, together we will hasten the day.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">While we seek a way to overcome the most challenging issue of our time, let’s not lose perspective. The mission of the church remains the same: “To make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world.” Knowing that the current </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;">conflict can drain the spirit, energy and resources that are essential to keep the body of Christ healthy and strong for mission,</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I refuse to be consumed by the conflict. The mission of the church is larger than whatever causes the conflict. The mission of the church demands and deserves our unsurpassing commitment with a sense of urgency, priority, and focus more than any other.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Here we are, Susquehanna Conference, gathered once again, under the theme of&nbsp; “Alive in Christ together….Raising up Transformational Leaders”. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">So we ask: Who are the transformational leaders? How do we raise-up transformational leaders? Why transformation?<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">We know that our church is having a tough time. The environment of our culture continues to grow to be unfavorable to us. Churches are in a fierce competition with other attractions and activities. Sports have become the dominant religion in America. The fastest growing segment of the current religious landscape is called “ the nons”, who claim themselves spiritual but not interested, if not hostile, to church or organized religion. The absence of young adults and the dwindling presence of youth and children in our congregations paint a bleak future for our church. This is no easy time for us to be a church. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Transformation in the life and ministry of our church is not optional for such a time as this.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A complacent church has little future. Business as usual will not work. Indeed, for some churches, no change now means no future. We still have sizable numbers of faithful people who have been with our church for a long time and will continue to be with our church for some time. Thanks be to God for them! However, more and more congregations are facing the ever-increasing challenge of sustaining their current status of being and doing the church. The channel of receiving new people to make up those who move away or die away in a rapid pace is getting narrower. A demographic study suggests an impending death tsunami among those who have been with our church so faithfully for a long time. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Then what will happen to our church? As most churches are slowly losing their presence in the community and its potency in ministry with continuing loss of membership, worship attendance, ministry engagement, and financial resources, what can be done before it is too late?&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Thanks be to God that we have many churches that have turned around and are turning around. Hear this: About one third of the churches of the Susquehanna Conference experienced growth in membership and worship attendance last year. We have churches of all sizes in all different places that continue to be vital and vibrant as they keep producing the fruit of ministry in abundance. They represent the presence of hope among us. Leaders in such churches are transformational. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A substantial and sustainable transformation of our church does not come with programs and resources. It comes with the transformational leaders, who serve as catalysts for transformation by making some critical shifts take place and take hold. Some shifts are essential to transformation. I would like to suggest that we start with a culture shift, a shift from a culture of low expectancy to a culture of high expectancy.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A different expectation brings different results.&nbsp; When little is expected, you get little and when much is expected, you get much.&nbsp; Jesus expected to get from his disciples not just Jerusalem, not just Judea, not just Samaria, but the whole world - and he got the world!<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">When anyone is baptized as a child of God, confirmed as a disciple of Jesus Christ, and received as a member of the United Methodist Church, let’s not be apologetic for or shy away from making our expectations emphatic and clear.&nbsp; People will never fulfill their potential as disciples of Jesus Christ if they are not clear and serious about what is expected from them.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The Book of Discipline has these words in it: “There was no place for those whom Wesley called the ‘almost Christians.’”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I believe that no one should stay long in a place of almost pastor or almost United Methodist. Every pastor is expected to be the best pastor that he or she can be.&nbsp; Every United Methodist is expected to be the best disciple that he or she can be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clergy and laity alike, all of us are expected to be the best ministers of the gospel that we can be, who strive to reach the expectation that God has for us.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Along with a cultural shift from low expectations to high expectations, I call upon our church to make a few critical transformational shifts. Once again, they are not about programs. They are about the fundamental reorientation of being and doing the church by challenging and changing our priorities, values, and attitude. They are shifts:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">(1) One, from a maintenance priority to a mission priority: It is about reclaiming the mission of the church, the purpose of our existence as a church of Jesus Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">(2) Two, from inwardly focused ministry to outwardly focused ministry: It is about making the intentional investment of ministry resources for the community and its people; and <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">(3) Three, from making members to making disciples: It’s about connecting our people to a faith journey and a movement rather than to a church as an institution.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">First, from a maintenance priority to a mission priority:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A growing number of churches are searching for answers that can help them stay vital and viable, not just barely making it. There is no simple or easy answer.&nbsp; However, one thing is clear to me.&nbsp; Unless people are excited, passionate, and enthused about the ministry of the church, motivating existing people, attracting new people, and thus drawing more resources for ministry will be unlikely. When people are preoccupied with keeping the doors open to survive and with building maintenance as priority, they are hardly excited and enthused for who they are and what they do as a church.&nbsp; Claiming mission as a priority by connecting the congregation to life changing, soul saving, community redeeming, and world transforming missions changes the tide.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A man was driving home. While driving, he was listening to his favorite music station. A one point, the disc jockey asked the audience, “When was the last time you brought flowers to your wife?” The driver thought that it would be a good idea, because he couldn’t remember the last time he had. It must have been a long, long time ago. So he dropped by a florist and bought a beautiful bouquet of flowers. He pulled his car in the garage and went to the front door and rang the bell. As his wife opened the door, he offered the bouquet, with big smile on his face. He said, “This is for you!”&nbsp; His wife, with a surprise look, said, “Oh no, today I had such a rough day. Jimmy was sick so I had to take him to the doctor. Tommy was in trouble in school, so I had to go school to see the principal. The washing machine broke.

I am willing to do something more, something extra, something unusual, and even something extraordinary as needed to keep our church alive in mission. Knowing that more mission would mean more lives touched, transformed, and even saved in the name and love of Jesus, I am willing to extend myself beyond the ordinary.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Susquehanna Conference, we must refuse to be a maintenance driven church and boldly claim to be a mission driven church for such a time as this.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Second, from inwardly focused ministry to outwardly focused ministry:<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Whether we thrive or wither as a congregation largely depends on our capacity of making connections with the people in our community.&nbsp; We know that.&nbsp; But where does a breakthrough come from?&nbsp; It comes from a radical shift of our ministry focus from inward to outward!<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I have watched our congregations shrink smaller and smaller, and the one common but significant factor that those congregations have in common is a decreasing engagement from their neighborhood. They become focused more and more on themselves and their survival. This is a trap that we must escape from. As long as we continue to look to our own needs first and exhaust our resources for us we become more like a self-preserving institution and less like a movement that reaches out and touches and transforms lives. This is a downward spiral we must break.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Our ministries must give more attention to and focus on those who are not yet with us in our church and our resources must be invested to serve the needs of our community. Let’s be reminded that our pastors are appointed to the community, as well as to a congregation. A vital connection with the community makes a vital congregation.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Radical shift from inward to outward turns a church around.

Sadly, membership is associated primarily with one’s privileges with minimum obligation, instead of with one’s commitments and responsibilities. The most disturbing thing about it is, for some, church membership has little to do with a journey of faith as a disciple of Jesus Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Church membership is not inherently wrong.
