Righteousness lodged in her – but now murderers! ... your wine is mixed with water.&nbsp; Your princes are ... thieves.&nbsp; They do not defend the orphan and the widow’s cause does not come before them” (1.21-23).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He renames <st1:city w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:city>“<st1:city w:st="on">Sodom</st1:city>” and “<st1:place w:st="on">Gomorrah</st1:place>”, two ancient and sin-filled cities destroyed by the LORD in a catastrophe of fire.&nbsp; And he proclaims that the powerful of the new <st1:city w:st="on">Sodom</st1:city>– <st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place> – will likewise perish: “They and their work shall burn together, with no one to quench them” (1.10, 31).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Merry Christmas to you too!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Shift gears with me: Cities.&nbsp; In the language of Timothy Keller, a city is any place of density, diversity, and cultural energy (video presentation 1, from <i>Gospel in Life: Grace Changes Everything</i>).&nbsp; If you look at a map of the world colored by population density, you will see red hot clusters at cities.&nbsp; It is as if cities have a gravitational field, drawing people in, calling to them in ever-increasing numbers.&nbsp; The Bible story is bookended by two cities.&nbsp; The first is <st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place>, a city of evil.&nbsp; The last is the New Jerusalem – exactly what Isaiah imagines here in chapter 2 – a city in which God’s dream for the city is made real.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For us who live outside of cities, a city is often a fearsome place.&nbsp; It is imagined to be a violent place, with racism and classism magnified by proximity and density.&nbsp; It is a place to go to escape from God and hide from the law.&nbsp; It glorifies excess, pride, and over-work.&nbsp; And it puts its faith in all kinds of false beliefs, particularly the God of Mammon, the love of money.&nbsp; God’s dream for the city is described here in Isaiah 2 and elsewhere in the Scripture as a place of refuge and safety, a place for justice, a center for cultural development, and a center for seeking and finding the one true living LORD (Keller).&nbsp; “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob” (2.3).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place> was destroyed.&nbsp; The old <st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place>of the prophet Isaiah will be destroyed.&nbsp; Devoured by the sword, burnt with fire (1.20, 31).&nbsp; But there will be survivors, and, “in days to come”, there will be a new Jerusalem, in the image of her Creator, in all justice and peace (1.9, 2.2).&nbsp; It is a message of hope, not the movie version of apocalypse, but the promise of God.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We struggle with this.&nbsp; We love the vision of justice and peace.&nbsp; And we know it is discontinuous with current reality.&nbsp; We love to live in the vision, in the word of the prophet.&nbsp; We don’t like to deal with the “brutal facts”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Jim Collins, in his book on organizational transformation, <i>Good to Great,</i>devotes a chapter to this theme.&nbsp; He titles it, “Confront the Brutal Facts, yet never lose faith”.&nbsp; He tells the story of Admiral Jim Stockdale, imprisoned for 8 years and tortured for over 20 times in <st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place>’s Hanoi Hilton.&nbsp; He developed a communication system for the prisoners of war, encoded intelligence into his letters to his wife, disfigured himself to avoid being used on video as a “well-treated prisoner”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a walk with <st1:place w:st="on">Stockton</st1:place>, Collins asked him, “Who didn’t make it out [of the prisoner of war experience]?”&nbsp; “Oh, that’s easy.&nbsp; The optimists.&nbsp; They were the ones who said, ‘We’re going to be out by Christmas.’ And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.&nbsp; Then they’d say, ‘We’re going to be out by Easter.’ ... And they died of a broken heart. ... You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end – which you can never afford to lose – with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be” (Collins, 83-85).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The most brutal facts of our current reality are that our world is not friendly to widows and orphans.&nbsp; Our world profits from the poor.&nbsp; Our world profits from war.&nbsp; Our world normalizes dishonesty, unfaithfulness, and anger.&nbsp; It is a beautiful world, filled with glimpses of glory, in the image of God carried by each human being.&nbsp; And yet, it is broken, and we are broken.&nbsp; We take up our sword to protect ourselves.&nbsp; We take up our sword to fight for justice.&nbsp; And with every sarcastic remark, every manipulative ploy, every power play, we and our cities, we and our nations, we and our neighborhoods, become more and more broken.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus said, “the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and violent men take hold of it” (Matthew 11.12).&nbsp; He was speaking about his kingdom, and he was speaking about himself as King.&nbsp; He would suffer violence.&nbsp; He would die at our hands, at the point of our swords.&nbsp; And all the destruction necessary to cleanse and remake this broken world was visited on him.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all we do with Isaiah’s vision of a restored <st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place>is love the idea, live in faith, but ignore the brutal facts of our current reality ... then we will be complicit with injustice, accomplice to evil, ever at war with God and with ourselves.&nbsp; We must hear the word of the prophet: “O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!” (2.5).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">How are we to participate in this transformation now?&nbsp; How can we, even now, live into the realities of the renewed Jerusalem Isaiah describes?&nbsp; How can we “walk in the light of the LORD”, practically?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 17.9pt;

When you sense yourself taking advantage of someone, profiting through their weakness ... that is the moment to make a personal change.&nbsp; And, when you have the opportunity to make a tangible difference for good in the life of another, do so.&nbsp; I am so excited that our youth have adopted a local family for Christmas.&nbsp; It is one dimension of the practice of justice – care and acceptance.&nbsp; Another dimension is advocacy – speaking up, acting up, making the system different.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 17.9pt;

When we surrender our swords, we disarm, unilaterally.&nbsp; If you want to “go up to the mountain of the LORD”, you must lay down your swords, you must disarm, you must surrender everything to God in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Once we do, we discover not an enemy to fight, but a lover and friend to embrace and a God who turn swords into plowshares, spears into pruning hooks.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Today we come to the table of our Lord, the feast of thanksgiving.&nbsp; As we remember the story, we discover that it was Jesus who surrendered to us at sword point, it was our violence that Jesus transformed into our deliverance, and it was our injustice that God used to bring us true peace.&nbsp; Truly, swords to plowshares, spears to pruning hooks.&nbsp; It is an amazing miracle, an incredible gift.&nbsp; And, it is ours to receive today.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Resources:</span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;
