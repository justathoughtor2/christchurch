</span>We say we are God’s people, but we worship Baal, calling him “master”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It’s idolatry, and it’s adultery, especially when we lie with sex workers at the altar to get close to Baal and to his goddess consort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In the wilderness with Moses, we made a golden calf idol, and we have repeated that – and gone much further – angering our jealous God.<o:p></o:p></span><br />  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I know jealousy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;

</span>She confused love and gifts, and wanted to give herself to anyone who made her feel special in that moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She thought she was in control, but I watched her self-destruct and could do nothing to stop it.<o:p></o:p></span></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I started to feel that I wasn’t the only man in her life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;

</span>The name was a reminder of the guilt of our royal house, a guilt that was to be visited in a series of royal assassinations, and much more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The name itself means “scatter”, a word for exile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I might as well have named the boy “Guilty”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And that’s the way Gomer behaved.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She was pregnant as soon as Jezreel was weaned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And this time, I knew for sure that I was not the father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our second child, a daughter, was named Lo-Ruhamah, “No Pity”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, a third child, another son, Lo-Ammi, “Not My People”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Over and over in the covenant, the LORD declares to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>: “I will be your God and you will be my people.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But my son is named “Not My People”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My heart was breaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I was so angry – “no pity” – but I could not stop loving Gomer or the kids.<o:p></o:p></span><br />  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then, the day came that ripped my heart out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;

</span>She didn’t want anything to do with them or with me either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She was guilty, she had no pity, she refused to claim us as her people.<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For a long time, I didn’t hear from her or even know where she was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I spent many sleepless nights wondering if there was anything I could have done differently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The kids ... the kids began to blame themselves for being abandoned by their mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They saw Gomer in the marketplace with another man, a master, a “Baal”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They wondered what to do the next time they saw her: <o:p></o:p></span><br />  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Hosea 2:2 </b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Plead with your mother, plead-- for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband-- that she remove the adulterous and unfaithful look from her face.

</span>The LORD is jealous, yes – jealous because the LORD is loving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After I named our second son “Not My People”, a sign of the broken covenant, the LORD reminded me of the covenant with Abraham:<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Hosea 1:10 </b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Yet the number of the people of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which can be neither measured nor numbered;

</span>So I bought her, not as a slave but to be my wife and lover once again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We call that, in Hebrew, to redeem a slave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
