<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #404040;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">From Bruce Dodson. Thanks Bruce!</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #404040;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #404040;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">My uncle was very active in the Memorial Presbyterian Church which used to hold services in the beautiful church in Wilkes Barre situated on the hill above the Luzerne County Courthouse.&nbsp; At one time it had a&nbsp; large congregation but unfortunately that dwindled through the years and the church went out of existence several years ago, selling the building to Kings College.&nbsp; At the time of my uncle’s funeral (2002) the church was still going (barely)and his funeral service was held there.&nbsp; An elderly member of their congregation with a beautiful voice was often called upon to sing during church services.&nbsp; He chose “He lives” &nbsp;to sing at the funeral.&nbsp; Before singing he announced that when he was a young boy Alfred Ackley served as minister at Memorial Presbyterian.&nbsp; As they were close in age, the soloist became friends with Rev. Ackley’s son and spent a good deal of time in their house.&nbsp; He remembers Rev. Ackley often being holed up in his study with the sliding doors closed. &nbsp;When these doors were closed the young boys were under strict orders to be quiet as they were told Rev. Ackley was working on a hymn, of which he composed 1500 or so during his life time (1887-1960).&nbsp; After his time at Memorial Presbyterian Rev. Ackley served at several other churches throughout the country, and it was at one of these latter churches where he wrote “He lives”.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #404040;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">After hearing the soloist story I researched this song and composer.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #404040;">As Rev. Ackley was preparing for his Easter message in 1932 he became upset at the comments he heard on the radio from a well-known liberal preacher, and also those of </span><span style="color: #404040;">young Jewish man he spoke with just a few weeks prior. &nbsp;&nbsp;This Jewish man asked Rev. Ackley why he should be expected to worship a dead Jew.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rev. Ackley replied that was the whole point, He isn’t dead; He’s alive!&nbsp; Rev. Ackley pondered this and gave his Easter Message.&nbsp; &nbsp;Afterwards he mentioned to his wife that he did not think the message fully delivered what he had intended it to say.&nbsp; His wife persuaded him to write a song about it, and that night he composed the words to &nbsp;</span><span style="color: #404040;">“He lives” &nbsp;and wrote the melody soon after.&nbsp; </span><span style="color: #404040;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #404040;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Although this hymn was not written here, I find it interesting that this noted composer served locally and probably wrote some of his other selections while he was here.</span></span></div>
