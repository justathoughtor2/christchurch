Agriculture was mostly non-existent or very primitive and unproductive. The Lunda Tribe had the highest infant mortality rates of all tribes in Zambia and the average life expectancy of the Lunda people was about 32 years. In 2000 many of the children between the ages of two and six were suffering from severe protein, vitamin and mineral deficiencies and severely underweight for their ages; they had classic potbellies, swollen feet, and reddish hair, common with those deficiencies. Villages were still semi-permanent with dirt floors, thatch roofs, and only mud brick walls. There was little access to green vegetables, or high protein foods. Milk was not available. Eggs when available were permitted to be eaten only by the adult men. With nothing to sell, most people existed in a cashless society where rats, mice, and insects were the only locally available protein foods.<br /><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br /><!--[endif]--></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the year 2000, the Kanyama Chiefdom had the lowest maize production in the entire district. By 2010, it was number one in maize production. The increase in family income has permitted more children to attend school and to have access to medical services.<br /><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br /><!--[endif]--></span></span><br /><span style="line-height: 107%;"><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/Give-to-Mission/Search-for-Projects/Projects/15016A"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Read the full story of our mission!</span></a></span><br /><span style="line-height: 107%;"><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/explore-our-work/missionaries-in-service/missionary-profiles/Webster-Paul"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Read the profile of the missionary.</span></a></span>
