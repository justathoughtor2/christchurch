Thanks to Joel Shuman for sharing the message this Sunday!<br /><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">Matthew 6:18-34; 7:7-11</span><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">(Psalm 39; Isaiah 58:1-12)<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">Almost from the beginning of the scriptural account of God’s saving work in history, God’s exhortation for his people to “be holy” stands as a dominant thread running through the entirety of the biblical story. From the giving of the ten commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai to Jesus’s gospel proclamation that the kingdom of God has come near to his reminding his followers that they are to be salt and light to the world around them, the primary focus of God’s redemptive work in the world has been to gather and form a distinctive community to bear witness to his intentions for the creation; not a religious people, nor a pious people, but a holy people, a people set apart, a people whose life together, devoted first to each other’s flourishing and happiness and ultimately to the flourishing and happiness of every one of God’s creatures, is declared by God to be the beginning of his coming reign on earth. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">The twentieth century author Flannery O’Connor once quipped, in a somewhat skewed echoing of the fourth Gospel, “The truth will set you free. But first, it will make you strange.” And so it goes with holiness. To be holy is to be whole; it is to flourish; it is to be blessed. But it is also to be different, to be set apart – not taken out of, but distinguished from – a world that is largely alienated from God, and thereby characterized by selfishness, greed, and blind ambition, and so filled with violence, injustice, and suffering. God’s people are called to be <i>not </i>like this, but instead to inhabit a peculiar, countercultural way of life, what Saint Augustine called an <i>altera civitas</i>, a “different city,” a community whose generous “politics of love” are often wildly opposed to the self-seeking “politics of security” that pervade the fallen creation. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">Today’s gospel text is about wealth, and at no point is the opposition between the logic and politics of the kingdom of God and that of the kingdoms of this world more conspicuously evident than in their respective attitudes toward the acquisition and use of wealth. Jesus spoke often of this opposition, reminding his followers and those others who gathered to hear him of the profound dangers of a life devoted to the pursuit of riches. “It is easier,” he said, “for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God” (Matt. 19:23-25). &nbsp;In this part of the Sermon on the Mount he throws the contrast into sharp relief, echoing both the first commandment and the oft-repeated truth that the real object of our worship, our real god, is whatever we value most, the thing toward which we most direct our time, our energy, our resources, and our attention. “For where your treasure is,” he reminds us, “there will your heart be also” (6:21). “No one,” he continues, “can serve two masters…. You cannot serve God and wealth” (6:24).<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;"></span></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">What was true of life in the ancient near east of Jesus’s day is at least as true, perhaps more so, of life in our own world today. The vision of the good life promoted by the broader society we inhabit is based almost totally on the relentless, single-minded pursuit of wealth and the things it can be used to acquire. An entire industry is dedicated to forming us in this way, committed to shaping and multiplying our desires, set on making us want more and more and more, making us people of chronic, insatiable, and fundamentally disordered desire – people the world refers to as “consumers.” &nbsp;It is consumption, we are frequently reminded, that drives our economy and enables our prosperity, and we are for the most part happy to respond positively to those who encourage us for the sake of the economy to work harder and buy more. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">“We live in a time,” says the essayist Wendell Berry, “when technologies and ideas… are adopted in response not to need but to advertising, salesmanship, and fashion. Salesmen and saleswomen now hover about us as persistently as angels, intent on ‘doing us good’ according to instructions set forth by persons educated at great public expense in the arts of greed and prevarication. These salespeople are now with most of us, apparently, even in our dreams.” From childhood through adolescence and into adulthood and beyond, we are assailed almost constantly by a vast assortment of messages designed to persuade us that our happiness and well-being depend absolutely on our having the newest product or the next big thing, whether it be a beverage or an article of clothing or a piece of technology or a car or a place to live or even a person other than the one we currently happen to be with. The message is clear, and always the same; contentment is tantamount to failure, and success depends on our consistently succumbing to the restless desire for something more or something different. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">We – you and I – are called to be different. But in spite of our having been made members of the people of God and offered a rich vision of a different way of life, each of us has been and continues to be shaped, to a greater or lesser extent, by the forces of this world. Each of us is affected by its basic message, which has penetrated so deeply it is practically part of our DNA. And because of this, we find ourselves perpetually anxious about wealth and its pursuit, and about whether and how we should seek to acquire any of the multitudes of symbols of status associated with it. We wonder whether we are wearing the right clothes, driving the right car, listening to the right music, living in the right neighborhood. Many of us worry almost constantly about money, and some of our worries are legitimate, for we live in difficult and complex times economically: In recent years a massive amount of wealth has moved out of the possession of the middle and working classes and into the hands of the wealthiest members of our society. Unemployment is high, especially among the memberships of historically marginalized communities, and the prospects for job growth are slight. Those of us who do have jobs work longer and harder, often for wages and salaries that have for years remained stagnant. And yet in spite of all this, we still find ourselves in the grasp of an inordinate desire for more. We spend more and save and give less, and we are often shackled by significant amounts of debt which, in combination with our misplaced ambition and disordered desire, keeps us from imagining anything different from the status quo. Where the pursuit and use of wealth is concerned, we increasingly face the loss of our distinctiveness as Christians, as we become ever-less salty, and our lights grow increasingly dim.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">Brothers and sisters, the vision proffered to us by the world is not one of success, but of slavery. What we need, and what we ought desperately to want, is not extraordinary wealth, but extraordinary freedom. And it is extraordinary freedom Jesus offers when he tells us to strive first, not after riches, but “for the kingdom of God and his righteousness.” In doing so we will discover that our true happiness lies not in the self-interested pursuit of affluence, but in self-giving friendship with God and the members of the community of his followers, through whom we will find that “all these things” – all the things we need and perhaps even some of those we want – will be given to us as well.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">What is this “kingdom of God,” and upon what logic, what tenets, is its “politics of love” based? How can our striving for it free us from the world’s “politics of security” and its associated competitive, self-interested, and often violent pursuit of affluence?<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">The kingdom of God is nothing other than God’s perfect, just, peaceable reign over a creation made explicitly for what the Old Testament sometimes calls <i>shalom</i>; a state of perfect, loving fellowship among the triune God, every woman and man, all the rest of God’s creatures, and the earth upon which all life depends. It is anticipated first in the covenant God made with Abraham, and again in God’s liberation, gathering and formation of Israel as his beloved holy people. It is ushered into existence in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth: in his calling followers; in his healing the sick and forgiving sin; in his feasting with women and men from all walks of life, including the marginalized and the unclean; in his teaching the way of God’s just, peaceable reign; and of course in his resurrection, which is both the final word in the struggle against sin and death and an authoritative affirmation of the righteousness of his life and teaching. The kingdom is haltingly and oh-so imperfectly present to the world now in the life of the church, the body of Christ, especially as we gather around the Lord’s Table, and then as we go into the world to serve – the poor, the sick, the homeless, the imprisoned, and all those without hope and without God in the world. And it is someday coming in glory, made perfect at the end of history in the descent from heaven of the New Jerusalem, the center of a new creation in which there will be no more death, mourning, crying, or pain, and where God in all his glory will be once again be perfectly present to his beloved creation.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">Now, in this time between the resurrection and the consummation, the kingdom of God is a place of faithful dependence on the steadfast love of God, who has given to us in the overflowing abundance of the creation all that we need, caring for us as he cares for the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. Such dependence is in part made possible, of course, by an active, living faith in God, which is cultivated through worship, prayer, and the study of Scripture. And yet the promised provision of our needs by God is far from a matter of personal piety and solitary faith, for the kingdom of God for which we are called to strive is a community – a membership – of which we all, through baptism, have been made a part. The basis of that community is love; the perfect, superabundant love of God; the love the persons of the Trinity share among themselves, and which overflows toward the creation. We are given this same love through the Holy Spirit, and called upon to extend it; toward each other, toward our neighbors, toward the poor and needy, and even toward our enemies. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">Such love is not simply an affective state, nor merely an attitude. Rather, it is an active verb that requires of us a just generosity toward God, toward one another, and ultimately toward all those we encounter who are in need. It is a generosity born of the recognition that every part of whom we are and all we have is a gift from God’s superabundance, given for our use and our pleasure, certainly, but also for freely sharing. We have been made part of the same body and given responsibility for each other’s well-being, such that, in the words of Saint Paul, “If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it” (1 Cor. 12:26).<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br /></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt;">None of this means that we should not continue to work, save, or plan for the future. It does not mean that we should not continue to enjoy the fruits of the creation God has so graciously given to us. It means, rather, that our working, saving, planning, and our spending and using are to be governed by a temperance born out of a realization that each of our lives and futures has been secured by the gracious love of the God who has, in the cross and resurrection of Jesus, already determined the outcome of history. That God, who is present to us in the life we share with one another as members of his people, has promised to care for us and to meet our every need. Most importantly, he has extended to us the offer of his friendship, thereby liberating us from bondage to greed and anxiety. The existence of such a free people is itself a manifestation of the kingdom of God, and so a declaration to the world of the good news that there is a better way to live, a way of just generosity. As we leave this place today and go into the world, let us do so with a dependence on God’s grace and a determination to embody that way. Thanks be to God.</span></div>
