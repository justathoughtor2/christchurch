Many students do not have allowances for food, transportation, or other means to meet basic school requirements. The children eventually drop out of school and are forced to work on the streets or commercial districts to help support their families' income. Some children are left to beg, steal or scavenge for food as a means of survival, while other children succumb to drug use, prostitution, or drug dealing.&nbsp;</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">Global Ministries' support will focus on out-of-school children ages 6-17 years old who reside in Navotas, Magsaysay, Parola, Tondo and Manilaâ€”areas which all have a high prevalence to substance abuse. The project will be carried out in partnership with United Methodist area churches and the Manila Annual Conference.</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">Through this project, children will receive basic education, health and other psychosocial services, as well as equip young students with the necessary life skills training. The program will also enhance the capacities of churches, parents and community leaders in responding to child development and protection issues. - <a href="http://www.umcmission.org/Find-Resources/Newsletters/connectNmission/2014/cNm-June#sthash.6d7j9kpo.dpuf">See more</a>!</span></span>
