You can’t just flip a switch.” <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .25in;">TP: In order to forgive my father, it took a very long time. I was connected to my anger, it was my fuel. Once I forgave him, the fuel didn’t work anymore. You give up the hope of that past ever being any different, but it is the most freeing thing you can do for yourself. Most of the time, the person you have not forgiven is living their life and probably has no idea what you are struggling with. They do not deserve to have that power over you, and you do not deserve to live that way.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Today, the internal dimension of reconciliation. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">James 4:1 – Those conflicts and disputes among you, where do they come from?

So, we’ll avoid conflict like the plague, creating an invisible gulf between us and others filled with conversational topics we just can’t discuss – and the gulf only becomes larger and larger – until it is far too visible. Or we’ll barge in to the conflict and steamroll people that we love, people who love us. But it will be their fault, not our responsibility. If we were rude or aggressive, that is only because they made us feel that way. The possibility that we could own our own feelings and govern our own reactions? We don’t go there. We remain conflicted.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, no wonder it is so hard for us to experience forgiveness. On the one hand, we are our own worst critics. On the other hand, we are so defensive that even a mild critique becomes the occasion for self-loathing and angry reactions.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder that in our conflicted state, we feel as if we cannot see our way forward, cannot solve our problems, cannot advocate for ourselves, cannot accept ourselves. We are operating in dark and dangerous territory.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">And John invites us to a totally new place, a new “zone”. Instead of darkness, he invites us to step into the light. It is John’s solution to the conflicted life described by James. It is John conducting orchestral harmony. It is reconciliation for the soul.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s what we need, according to John: A place where we can speak the truth, and be safe doing it. It’s genius. It’s what conflict and negotiation theorists like the famous Harvard Negotiation Project have been studying and teaching in recent decades, but it is nothing new. Not, at least, if we listen carefully to what John is saying.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the earliest age, we teach children that telling the truth is dangerous, not safe (see also GLS, Joseph Grenney) – even in our own home. “Were you the one who forgot to put the cereal away?” “Did you forget to flush the toilet?” It’s not calculus or rocket science. If I say “yes”, dad is mad and I’m in trouble. If I say “no”, dad is just puzzled. Most of human reasoning is actually emotional in nature. We fail to pay attention to the long term impact of our lies when, for a small lie, we can have peace in a relationship now. It would be much easier if we created a safe zone that was ALSO a truth zone.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">That’s exactly what Jesus has done. John confronts us with the brutal truth that “if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us” (1 John 1.8). And he invites us to confess our sin, to tell the truth. And, this truth zone is also a safe zone. “If we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin” (1.7). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This truth zone – a place of light where we can see where we are going, where our conflicted selves move forward with inner harmony, confidence, and hope (more or less, in our imperfect world). . . .&nbsp; This truth zone is a safe zone with two indispensable gifts: <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">First, fellowship with each other. In Jesus’ truth zone, speaking truth does not separate us from each other. It is lies that do that. But speaking truth – even when it involves confessing sin, admitting the ways that we are the problem – speaking truth actually connects us with those who love us. We fear being vulnerable. It does not feel safe. But in the truth zone of Jesus we have safety guaranteed – fellowship with each other.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second gift of this safe zone is forgiveness, forgiveness “from all sin”. “Blessed are those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered” (Psalm 32.1). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Most of us are carrying a few things for which we haven’t been able to forgive ourselves. We know we’re the problem. We know we’re conflicted. We know we’re operating in the dark. We know these burdens shape and fill a gulf, a great pit, between us and those we love. But we have never found the truth zone that was also a safe zone. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We fear confession, because it is does not seem safe. It puts us at risk. It makes us vulnerable. Everyone wants to know whose fault it is – and, once we confess, we’ve answered that question for everyone. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, the woman kneeling and weeping at the feet of Jesus (Luke 7.36-50) has found that truth zone that is also a safe zone. She was not safe from the judgment of Simon, but she is safe before Jesus, safe to bring her secrets, safe to bring her tears. He knows the truth and he proclaims, “You are forgiven.” <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe, as much as you desire it, you have not found the truth zone that is also a safe zone. Until now. John uses the word “confess” and invites you to take the leap. It is scary. “Confess” is a word for “tell the truth about” something – in this case, about how we are the problem, about our sin. James uses the same language at the end of his letter: “Anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed” (James 5.15-16). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you recognize your conflicted self and desire reconciliation for your soul, if you hear the promise of fellowship and forgiveness and crave that safe zone, if you know yourself to be in the dark and desire the light of God’s truth, I urge you to confess your sin today.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">First, confess to God. Perhaps you will want to come to the altar, kneel or stand, and make your confession. Perhaps you will kneel in your pew. Make your confession. Speak words in your soul and bring the truth before our God who promises forgiveness and fellowship.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, seek a safe person to confess with. For me, that has often been Robin. She has created a safe zone for me to be true – and helped me enter the forgiveness and fellowship Jesus offers.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Global Leadership Summit 2014, personal notes<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willowcreek.com/summit<o:p></o:p></div>
