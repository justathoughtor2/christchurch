In each case, they are initiated by God and, though they are made with certain individuals or groups, are integrated into God’s larger plan for the human race. They teach us what it means to be God’s people, fulfilling the ancient purpose of Lent, to train initiates to make their baptismal vows as disciples of Jesus.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first covenant we explored was made with Noah, with “all flesh” including the creatures, and its sign was God’s bow – a weapon – hung in the clouds, retired from use. The second was one made with Abraham, expressed and developed in at least three separate encounters between Abraham and God, designed to bless him and make him a blessing to “all families on earth”, and to claim him and his heirs as “my people” and be to them “your God”. Its sign was circumcision.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we explore a covenant God makes with the people of Israel – the heirs of Abraham – focused in the commands given at Sinai out of a terrible vision of God’s glory, so glorious that no one, and no creature, could approach the mountain unbidden, or touch it, lest they die. When the LORD finishes giving these commands, we are told that all Israel heard the voice but could not endure before it: You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die (Exodus 20.19). The sign of this covenant, the covenant of Torah, a word for “Law” or “Teaching”, is the stone tablets. As in, “take two tablets and call me in the morning.” Despite the humor, much spiritual guidance boils down to a slogan-like “just do it” obedience. If we refuse to obey, why wonder that we struggle to find ourselves close to God?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Yet, God’s “top ten” list is hardly a simple list of rules. There is so much in this passage. We could focus one at a time on each of the commands individually. “Do not murder” and “do not commit adultery” open up the controversy can of worms around human life and human sexuality. “Honor your father and your mother” interestingly, does NOT say “obey”. There is an implicit understanding that our highest loyalty and deepest obedience is to God alone, not to mom and dad. And, at the same time, a command like this prevents adult children from kicking dear old dad to the curb just because he can no longer earn his keep. In addition, it reminds us of how important it is in the community of faith for our story to be passed from one generation to the next (see Brueggemann, 847, 849). “Do not covet”, command number ten, is linked thematically with the first command, “you shall have no other gods before me”. How so? Well, Paul describes “greed” as “idolatry” (852, Colossians 3.5). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond examining the commandments individually, the passage invites us to consider the commandments, as a group, in the context of moral development. My father-in-law did a lot of work applying Lawrence Kohlberg’s stages of moral development in a number of unique populations, from gifted young persons to dual-diagnosed adults with felony convictions. The stages begin with obedience to avoid punishment, move on to self-interest (seeking the benefit that comes with obedience), to conformity to social expectations, and eventually to “universal ethical principles” (Wikipedia). The New Testament looks back at the Law and remarks, “The law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith” (Galatians 3.24). Despite this, many followers of Jesus have not moved on to what could be called the “faith” stage of spiritual development; we’re still stuck in disciplinarian mode: “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can also look at the commandments as a group in the context of the development of a nation. When Israel went down into Egypt, Israel was a large extended family. While there, they became slaves. They had never been a nation, never had the opportunity to develop their own government and leadership, their expectations and accountability. Our own nation was formed by free men, with experience and academic training in governing and leadership, and even then their first stab at government, the Articles of Confederation, was a failure. These commandments, and this covenant, were crucial to structuring the identity of a nation.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can look at these commandments as summarized elsewhere in the Torah and by Jesus as “the first and greatest commandment” to love the Lord your God and the “second, like it” to love your neighbor (Matthew 22.34-40). Our confirmation class studies this each year and we hear from them that we are called to “love God, love everyone”. In so many ways, this “top ten”, along with the top two summary, are the foundation for all Christian ethics.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">But, today, I want us to focus on what this covenant teaches us about our God. In the covenant with Noah, we learned that God is a God of second chances. In the covenant with Abraham, we learned that God wants to lay claim not just to Abraham and his offspring but to the entire human race, to declare “mine” over each one of us. In this covenant with Israel as an emerging nation, we discover that God has a personal history with two major themes – liberation and creation (see Moltmann, 50-65).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;” (Exodus 20.2). Worshiping a God who liberates slaves has certain social consequences (see Brueggemann, 840).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;">·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]-->We once worked like slaves.

But now we recognize that the God who breathed life into us, made us a living soul, desires an intimate and covenantal life with us, and desires that we experience and celebrate our sexuality in the context of covenant faithfulness.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">God’s history in creation and liberation/redemption have huge and countless implications for ethics. No surprise, then, that God gives us the ten commandments. Walter Brueggemann writes: “The commands are a decisive way in which Israel (and Yahweh) intend to sustain and institutionalize the revolutionary social possibility that is asserted and enacted in the exodus narrative” (839). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the institutionalization of the exodus, the implications for ethics, are secondary to what we learn about God, that God’s history is found in creation and liberation. As I introduce myself as Robin’s husband and the pastor of Christ Church, defining myself in terms of my major relationships and actions, so Godself is introduced as creator of the entire universe and redeemer of slaves. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first case, creation, we discover that God’s affection and passion have no boundary. In the second, we are stunned to find God entering our suffering, joining us in the pain, and liberating us from our slaveries not simply as a power greater than the slave master, but as a slave with us (see Philippians 2.5-11 and Exodus 3.7-8). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking personally, this is a God whom I would love to know and follow, one whose boundless love includes me, one who joins me in my suffering and pain, one who sets me free from all the other gods that compete for my loyalty – the gods of security and success, the gods of my relationships, the gods of pleasure and desire (see Brueggemann, “theological emancipation”, 841). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Resources:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Walter Brueggemann, <i>New Interpreter’s Bible, Vol I, </i>Exodus.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Jurgen Moltmann, <i>The Church in the Power of the Spirit.<o:p></o:p></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development</a><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Meghan Trainor. “All About that Bass”, <i>Title,</i>2015 Jan 15.<o:p></o:p></div>
