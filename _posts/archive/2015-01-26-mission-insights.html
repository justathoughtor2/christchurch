<span style="background-color: white;">By the <a href="http://www.umcmission.org/Find-Resources/Newsletters/connectNmission/2015/cNm-January">General Secretary of the General Board of Global Ministries</a>:</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><em style="background-color: white; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></em></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><em style="background-color: white; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and wailing.<br />It’s Rachel crying for her children; she refuses to be consoled,<br />because her children are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15, CEB)&nbsp;</em><br style="background-color: white;" /><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">The past few weeks have been filled with violence and loss. Even as we were processing the pain felt in France and Yemen, we began to hear reports of the massacre by the Boko Haram in Baga, a small town in Borno State, Nigeria. According to Human Rights Watch, the extremist group burned much of the 10,000 resident town and took control of 16 neighboring villages displacing more than 30,000 people. Reports vary widely regarding the Baga massacre, but the death toll is estimated to be in the hundreds, with some reports placing it as high as 2,000.</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">Please join me in praying for all who are affected by these evil acts. The General Board of Global Ministries condemns this brutality. We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters who are building peace in the face of atrocity. We continue to pray for peace in northeast Nigeria where the Boko Haram has unleashed years of terror.</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">Dr. Olusimbo Ige, who works with Global Ministries’ Global Health unit, is originally from Nigeria. In response to the tragic news she lamented, “It is sad that young girls can be kidnapped, innocents slaughtered and entire villages and towns taken over with such impunity. Our thoughts and prayers are with our sisters and brothers in Nigeria and we join our voices with those of others praying for peace and justice to reign in Nigeria.”</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">Please join Dr. Ige and the people of Nigeria in the lifting up the words of the Nigerian National Anthem, “O God of all creation direct our noble cause, guide our leaders right. Help our youth the truth to know, in love and honesty to grow, and living just and true, great lofty heights attain to build a nation where peace and justice shall reign.”&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white;"><a href="http://www.umcmission.org/Find-Resources/Newsletters/connectNmission/2015/cNm-January">See the entire ConnectNMission Update.</a></span>
