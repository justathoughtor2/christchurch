<span style="font-family: inherit;">The war in Syria continues with impacts reaching far beyond its borders. With no sign of a pending peace agreement, thousands of Syrian-Armenian refugees have traveled to Armenia in search of a secure and safe refuge. More than 10,000 Syrian-Armenian refugees have fled to Armenia since the fighting started two years ago; among them, 7,000 have applied for residency. The Syrian city of Aleppo, which was home to most of Syriaâ€™s 100,000 Armenians, has seen some of the heaviest fighting. <br /><br />The United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) is supporting these refugees by facilitating their integration in Armenia. Specifically, UMCOR will provide hygiene kits to 1,334 displaced Syrian families, psychological support, and Armenian language classes for school age children.&nbsp;</span>
