(I have neither read the book nor seen the movie.) There is a scene between Nick and his son Joe as Joe is trying to learn what the father does. Dad, Nick, says that “I am never wrong; if your job is to be right, then you are never wrong”, and they set up a simple debate to demonstrate. Ice cream – chocolate or vanilla? Nick says that this is an argument you can’t win. You love chocolate? It is the “be all and end all” for you? Great. “I need more than chocolate, and for that matter I need more than vanilla. I believe that we need freedom and choice when it comes to our ice cream and that, that is the definition of liberty.” “But you didn’t prove that vanilla is the best. You didn’t convince me.” “But I proved that you are wrong and if you are wrong, then I’m right. And I’m not after you, I’m after them.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This is called “rejecting the premise of the question”, a technique that every successful lobbyist, politician, and commentator masters. And a technique that is pretty helpful to parents as well. In the adversarial situations of life, the “gotcha” element is in the premise of a question.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor or not?” (Matthew 22.17). That’s a loaded question! Yes? Then you legalize the occupation of our country. No? Then you identify yourself publically as a rebel. It is a loaded question because of the premise, which is that this is indeed an either-or situation. Either you support a totalitarian regime that is occupying and oppressing your people OR you support resistance and rebellion.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus rejects the premise of the question. “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s” (22.21). So the question is no longer about paying taxes but about giving what is due. The question is no longer either-or but now both-and. The question is no longer about occupation but about obligation. “When they heard this, they were amazed; and they left him and went away” (22.22).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal">In the church and state conversation, there’s a ton of fear and anxiety. “They”, that is, the secularists, “have taken prayer out of school. We are a Christian nation. What will they take next?” “They”, that is, the Christians, “are trying to dominate the rest of us with their singular view of reality.” These are power conversations, power narratives – like whether or not to pay taxes to the emperor – and it is time to reject the premise of the question. Why reject the premise? First of all, because the conversation as currently constructed gets us nowhere fast. Second, because the premise of the question is quite simply wrong.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to rejecting the premise, it is time to pull an Abraham Lincoln. In one of his political campaigns in Illinois, he and his opponent traveled together for a series of speeches. They’d take turns going first or second, give their stump speeches, press the flesh, eat meals, and head on to the next town. Lincoln memorized his opponent’s speech and, when it was his turn to go first, he gave his opponent’s speech, leaving him quite literally speech-less (Goodwin … page unknown). Doing a little speech-stealing can take an argument to a new and unexpected level. What would it do to the conversation in our culture for Christians to say to secularists: “Did you know that the separation of church and state was Jesus’ idea?” “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Let’s take a look at some of the premises that underlie the Christian-secularist conversation and, by extension, the church and state debate today.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>That the faith of our founding fathers is important to the identity of our faith and nation.</b> Both Christians and atheists can marshal a pile of quotes and anecdotes to suggest that our founding fathers agree with them. To a limited degree, both are right and both are wrong. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our nation was founded on largely Christian ideals, though not all our founders were Christians, and not all the ideals were Christian. For example, Thomas Jefferson was not a Christian but a Deist. In a presidential campaign, Jefferson was labeled a “howling Atheist” (Edwards). He liked the Bible but disagreed with large sections of it. So, he literally cut and pasted together his own personal edition of the New Testament. And, a second example: the idea that the “pursuit of happiness” is a good thing and a divinely given right is not exactly biblical. Happiness isn’t bad in itself, it’s just that the Scriptures call us to pursue holiness and godliness with contentment, which is entirely different from pursuing happiness. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguing over the faith of our founders takes us nowhere. The founders are the founders for the whole nation, no matter our religion or rejection of religion. And, for us to identify too easily and uncritically with the values of our founders (who, by the way, did not allow women to vote and counted slaves as 3/5 of a person) makes it impossible for us to “give to God what is God’s”, including providing a prophetic voice that speaks up for the values of God’s kingdom.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>That the future of faith and secularism in our nation is to be found in Europe.</b> Many of today’s Christians fear that we in the USA are heading down a “slippery slope” toward “post-Christian” secular Europe. Indeed, over and over people talk about a post-Christian West in general and recent surveys of religious affiliation in the USA indicate that the fastest growing group is the “nones”, that is, persons with no religious affiliation at all. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are a couple huge reasons why our story does not and cannot parallel Europe’s. First, in Europe there are still establishment churches, churches that are funded by taxes. A big reason that the church became irrelevant in Europe is because there was no separation of church and state, so the church spoke for the state rather than raising its voice on behalf of the kingdom of God. Yes, there is religious freedom in Europe, ironically set alongside establishment religion. And non-establishment churches, including The United Methodist Church, are reaching people that the establishment churches cannot.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason why our story will not parallel Europe’s is that secularism in Europe has a different historical root (Sanneh, 9). Secularism in the USA actually has its roots in the mostly Christian ideals of our founders, the gospel text of giving to Caesar and giving to God, and the value of individual freedom of choice in regard to faith. In western Europe, however, secularism developed from atheistic philosophers of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. In the east, secularism developed from the atheism of Marxism. Despite the hard secularism of Europe, the church of Jesus Christ there is finding her voice again and making new disciples for Jesus. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third thing we must keep in mind is that much of what we see as decreasing religious affiliation is a product of life cycles of churches and movements. Grandma loved Jesus with all her heart. Her kids go to church because that is just what you do. Her grandkids see mom and dad “going through the motions” and stop coming but they still believe. (Mom and dad are upset, because they don’t think of themselves as “going through the motions”.) The great grandkids figure that believing in something you don’t practice doesn’t make much sense so they not only don’t come to church, they just don’t believe. Without a fresh witness and renewed mission in every generation, this normal life cycle process moves forward and a once thriving congregation or denomination suddenly finds itself closed.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of worrying about our future, we need to reclaim our mission and love Jesus with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>That the church needs the power, or at least the tacit support or permission, of the state in order to flourish. That the church seeks power.</b> While there are certainly Christians, on both the cultural left and the cultural right, who do seek power on behalf of their vision of the church, this premise is no more accurate than any other. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit A: The establishment churches in Europe, which are in steep decline. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit B: The church in Africa in the first three centuries. Tertullian, an ancient theologian of North Africa, declared, “The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church.” Martyrs, by definition, have lost all political power, including life itself. They understood that sometimes giving to God what is God’s means that we stand powerless before the state. Remember the story we told with the children. Daniel’s three friends refused to bow down to the king’s statue. “Our God is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us. But if not, we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue” (Daniel 3.17-18; there are translation variants for v17). “But if not.” That is, they were willing to die faithful. If we think we’ve got it bad, in terms of persecution or pressure as Christians in the USA, really, we’ve got nothing. The letter to the Hebrews states, “You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood” (Hebrews 12.4).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit C: The church in Africa over the last 100 years. Back in 1910, Muslims outnumbered Christians in Africa 4:1 and John R. Mott, one of the great mission leaders of his generation, predicted that Africa would be taken over by Islam (Sanneh, 14). Now, Christians outnumber Muslims in Africa, even with the Arab nations in the north (CSGC) and will soon be over 50% of the population of Africa (Sanneh, CSGC). The huge acceleration of church growth has taken most folks by surprise. And, it happened after the end of European colonialism, without the support of the colonial governments, and often without the presence of western missionaries. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit D: Jesus, always Jesus: “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. … I am among you as one who serves” (Luke 22.25-26).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>That the church’s claim that Jesus is the unique Savior supports an intolerant and exclusive practice.</b> Secularism fears that Christianity desires to convert everyone and make them all the same, and there are certainly Christian persons who approach their mission in that way.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, consider the historical evidence, particularly that of Bible translation. The Christian Scriptures are the most widely translated book, and <i>it is still the Bible, no matter the language.</i> The Qur’an, however, is only the Qur’an in Arabic, and your five-times-a-day prayers are to be made in Arabic, whether or not you speak the language.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Africa, Islam has grown among peoples whose native cultures were destroyed by colonialism, actually benefitting from the process of globalization. Christianity, however, has grown among adherents of traditional religions because Christian missionaries translated the Scriptures into their languages, used their names for God, and allowed their culture and traditions to be preserved instead of lost to globalization.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lamin Sanneh, a church historian and theologian from Gambia, suggests that this translatable genius of the Christian faith undermines one of secularism’s key arguments, that a “tolerant world” must abandon “Christian exclusivism” (16, see 14-21, 36, 111). He takes it a step further, noting ironically that “a blanket secular inclusivism turned out to have exclusivist religious holes” (17).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>That public and state-supported faith symbols and practices support the spiritual formation of disciples of Jesus.</b>Many Christians react as if secularization is taking something from us, whether it is the Ten Commandments in a courthouse or prayer in schools. But no one can stop anyone else from praying! We treat these matters as if they have a huge impact on spiritual formation, but, quite simply, they don’t. So we spend all our time arguing over symbols that have no impact. The Constitutional issues aside, none of these public symbols are going to make me a better follower of Jesus or help me teach my children to follow Jesus. Caesar’s kingdom and Jesus’ kingdom are not the same.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>That religion is a private matter.</b> This is one of the core convictions of secularism. Religion is private, and not to impact the state in any way, as the state is a public entity. Religious faith is intensely personal, but it is not at all private. It is lived out in a public arena, whether the arena of the martyrs or the arena of the work place, school, and community. Too often, however, followers of Jesus have accepted this premise. This is to miss the power of what Jesus said to the Herodians: “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” Jesus’ remark did not divide life into public and private; it divided the world into two kingdoms, the kingdoms of this world (Caesar) and the kingdom of God. There was never a question of which King was the most important and there was never a question whether kingdom language is political, public language. While it is not easy in complex issues to stand clearly for the kingdom of God, that is our call.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Give to Caesar:</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vote.
