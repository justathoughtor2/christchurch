<span style="font-family: inherit;">Kariba is an isolated district in northern Zimbabwe. Low rainfall, limited access to seeds and other resources, and the encroachment of wildlife are all contributing to reduced crop production and greater food insecurity for residents of Kariba. <br /><br />The United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) is helping to address this situation, while also supporting the livelihoods of community members through a cash-for-work project. <br /><br />Supplementing a World Food Program emergency food-security project, UMCOR will help establish a fish pond and market in one Kariba municipality, and seven community nutrition centers across four municipalities, which will improve the communitiesâ€™ daily diet and improve livelihoods. <br /><br />Apart from this work, there also will be the construction and rehabilitation of small earth dams to help boost crop production through irrigation and the creation of a water network system that will support the gardens at the community nutrition centers. <br /><br />About 2,630 beneficiaries will be identified to participate in this cash-for-work training program; 50 percent of whom will be women. </span><br /><!--[endif]-->
