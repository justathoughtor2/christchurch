<div class="MsoNormal">2013/12/15&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal">Isaiah 35.1-10</div><div class="MsoNormal">(No video at this time)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We come today to another salvation song of the prophet.&nbsp; As we have said in our earlier weeks, each of these salvation songs is matched to a judgment proclamation.&nbsp; We have a cue in this text itself: “Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you” (Isaiah 35:4).&nbsp; Indeed, the chapter prior to our section, this vengeance is described in terrifying detail.&nbsp; The language used is that of “doom”, the ancient “devotion to destruction” in which every person, every creature, and every piece of property was to be destroyed in an act of obedience (Brueggemann, 269).&nbsp; And, the “doom” was a universal doom:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in;">The LORD is enraged against all the nations.&nbsp; The stench of their corpses shall rise.&nbsp; All the hosts of heaven shall rot away (34:2-4).</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We struggle today with language like this, struggle to connect it to the understanding of “gospel”, of “good news”, that “God so loved the world”.&nbsp; For the prophet, there was no difficulty connecting this with a salvation song, no trouble recognizing that the LORD’s vengeance means not only destruction of the world that was, but destruction of a world that is inherently broken, riddled with sin, and must be set right.&nbsp; Our salvation can only come when the world itself is set right.&nbsp; </div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No surprise that Isaiah’s salvation songs are also full of creation language.&nbsp; Last week we saw a new shoot coming from a stump and a lion lying down with a lamb.&nbsp; Today, the creation language is one of transformation from desert to garden, from drought to fertility.&nbsp; And between layers of creation transformation we see a transformation of God’s new or renewed community.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Walter Brueggemann says that each of these layers has a “before” and “after”, a story or image of transformation.&nbsp; For creation, he speaks of a movement from “drought” to “fertility”, for the human community a movement from “disability” to strength (275-277).</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We know what drought does.&nbsp; Plants droop.&nbsp; Corn and other crops shrivel.&nbsp; Topsoil dries up and blows away.&nbsp; Animals and people starve.&nbsp; We know what drought does, and we have experienced it in our personal lives: When what once offered joy is now a source of pain, when hopes and dreams evaporate, when the best and most important people in our lives are simply gone.&nbsp; </div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death of Mateusz.&nbsp; We are in the desert, and we are thirsty.</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder the prophet declares: “Strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees”.&nbsp; No wonder he calls out, “Be strong! Do not fear!”&nbsp; Because our God is here.&nbsp; Our God comes to save.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We know a little bit about disability.&nbsp; Blind, deaf, lame, mute.&nbsp; Often, the physical dimension is much less significant than the social dimension, the exclusion.&nbsp; Everyone stares.&nbsp; People who genuinely want to connect are awkward about it.&nbsp; If you are doing well, you’re an “inspiration”.&nbsp; If you’re struggling, you’re invisible (except for the staring).</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve begun to recognize that disabilities come in many forms, that the list is much longer than what the ancient prophet offers.&nbsp; We now recognize mental illness and developmental disability.&nbsp; But for those of us who are able-bodied and neuro-typical, we are content to think of disability as someone else’s problem.&nbsp; We overlook our brokenness.&nbsp; And, we’re – all of us – broken.&nbsp; And, whether we recognize it or not, we’re all thirsty.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The concluding portion of the vision, on human community, describes the redeemed returning to mother <st1:city w:st="on">Zion</st1:city>, singing songs of praise to the LORD.&nbsp; They travel on a highway, a highway built through former desert, a highway that is bordered by beautiful gardens, by flowers and streams.&nbsp; It is the <st1:street w:st="on">Holy Way</st1:street>, and “the unclean shall not travel on it”.&nbsp; Here, for the first time, the language of the prophet appears to be exclusive.&nbsp; No one unclean, no lions or ravenous beasts.&nbsp; But, in the prior chapter, the judgment was universal.&nbsp; And, earlier in this chapter, the promise seems inclusive as well – the desert becomes garden, the lame leap, the blind see.</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the prophet is actually speaking inclusively here as well.&nbsp; The clean who travel on this way, the ransomed and redeemed of the LORD, are the blind, deaf, lame, and mute described in the prior movement.&nbsp; It is the broken and excluded, all those who would be disqualified today, who lead the ranks of the redeemed in God’s kingdom come.</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a translation question in verse 8.&nbsp; The phrase regarding “fools” is either excluding or including them.&nbsp; The Hebrew is unclear, and the English translations vary.&nbsp; I prefer, because of the context, the translation of the NRSV: “No traveler, not even fools, shall go astray.”&nbsp; It is an incredible promise.&nbsp; “Fools” for ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region> were not simply people without common sense.&nbsp; “Fools” were people who rejected God altogether (Psalm 14.1).&nbsp; Yet, for Isaiah the prophet, on this <st1:street w:st="on">Holy Way</st1:street> even the fool can’t get lost.</div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This vision can be upsetting.&nbsp; We don’t embrace our brokenness, so the idea that the broken lead the redemption band is a problem.&nbsp; We want the “faithful” label and we imagine ourselves to be better than folks who don’t share our faith.&nbsp; The idea that “fools” – atheists, perhaps – could find entrance to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">kingdom</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename w:st="on">God</st1:placename></st1:place> is really uncomfortable.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Mrs. Turpin:</div><div class="MsoNormal">There was only a purple streak in the sky, cutting through a field of crimson</div><div class="MsoNormal">and leading, like an extension of the highway, into the descending</div><div class="MsoNormal">dusk. A visionary light settled in her eyes. She saw the streak</div><div class="MsoNormal">as a vast swinging bridge extending upward from the earth through a</div><div class="MsoNormal">field of living fire. Upon it a vast horde of souls</div><div class="MsoNormal">were tumbling toward heaven. There were whole companies of white</div><div class="MsoNormal">trash, clean for the first time in their lives, and bands of black niggers in</div><div class="MsoNormal">white robes, and battalions of freaks and lunatics shouting and</div><div class="MsoNormal">clapping and leaping like frogs. And bringing up the end of the</div><div class="MsoNormal">procession was a tribe of people whom she recognized at once as those</div><div class="MsoNormal">who, like herself and Claud, had always had a little of everything and</div><div class="MsoNormal">the given wit to use it right.
