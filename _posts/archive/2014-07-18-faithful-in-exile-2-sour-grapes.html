And, we love judgment, don’t we? The passage exposes all kinds of questions, misconceptions, and anxieties we have with judgment in general, and God’s judgment in particular. Did God have a personality change between the OT and the NT – or perhaps a good psychiatrist? Didn’t Jesus tell us, “Judge not, lest you be judged” (Mt 7.2)? To what degree could sin and judgment be an inherited trait? To what degree are we responsible for the sins of our children and grandchildren? Can we “bank” our good deeds enough to wipe out whatever wrong we have done? Or can one wrong deed wipe out a lifetime of otherwise good behavior? <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Last week, as we were introduced to Ezekiel, we learned that, among other things, Ezekiel was a great visionary. This is not one of his visions. The other messages in this series are from his visions, but this is not one of them. This is a sustained argument with the exiles of Judah, now living near the Chebar Canal in Babylonia, and the argument is about the justice, the judgment, of God.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that the exiles have lived through horror – the rape, murder, and torture of friends and neighbors – and now find themselves in a foreign land, without the comforts of home, temple, or king. Nevertheless, they – on one hand – hold on to the promise of God to Israel, to the house and line of David, to Jerusalem and the Temple, and they believe, fancifully, that God will bring them back. Ezekiel has been proclaiming that God’s judgment has just begun, that exile will be long, that Judah, the temple, the palace, the city of Jerusalem, will be totally destroyed. On one hand, the exiles are holding on to a naïve hope.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand … there is cynical despair. If they are being judged, it is for the sins of their ancestors over many generations. They are, in the words of Katheryn Darr, “bound by chains they did not forge”. And, if I am not responsible for the fix I am in, then there is nothing I can do to get out of it. It’s all someone else’s fault – cynical despair. And, isn’t it a whole lot easier to blame someone else – whether the baggage from our parents, the injustice of God, or the randomness of the universe – than to take responsibility for our own sin, our own injustice, our own random disregard for our neighbors, for the earth, for our God? (See Darr.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ezekiel argues with the exiles, first with reason, then with passion, attempting to break through the naïveté and the cynicism. “What do you mean by repeating this proverb?” (18.2) “Yet you say, ‘Why shouldn’t the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?'" (18.19). “Yet you say, ‘The way of the LORD is unfair!’” (18.25). Ezekiel argues, and it’s all about judgment, what judgment means, whether judgment is just. And, here’s the crazy thing: In the judgment of God Ezekiel finds the grounds for hope.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I’d like to take time to explore some of our attitudes towards judgment and, as we do so, dip repeatedly into the text of Ezekiel’s argument with the exiles.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>First, this perception that God’s personality</b>, God’s disposition toward human beings, is radically different between the OT and NT texts. Some folks even say, “Old Testament God” and “New Testament God”, as if they are two gods. Not that they believe there are two gods, but that they see such a huge difference between these two major episodes of the biblical story. Now, we confess faith in “one God”. We follow Jesus, who understood himself and his ministry in terms of the Hebrew Scriptures, our Old Testament.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be fair, there is plenty of harsh judgment language in the Old Testament. Have you read the story of Jesus’ on the cross? One of the ways the NT describes this story, and its purpose in our salvation, is as an expression of the judgment of God on our sin. Sometimes, we embrace the biblical promise of forgiveness and reconciliation, but we completely overlook the price that Jesus paid to make it possible. We are not forgiven without judgment – and, fortunately for us, Jesus took that judgment for us. In the judgment of God, there is hope.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, though there is plenty of harsh judgment language in the OT, there is also an abundance of promise, hope, forgiveness, deliverance. We can’t afford to listen only to one side of the conversation, to read only select portions of the story. Here in our passage, and this is one example of many OT texts that we could cite, the LORD declares, “Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? … I have no pleasure in the death of anyone. Turn, then, and live” (18.23, 32). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea that the “OT God” is simply waiting around to zap us for our sin – for that $20 we failed to report to the IRS, for that library book we did not return on time, for that internet porn we downloaded, for that litter we dropped on the trail – that image of God is simply inconsistent with the testimony of the OT itself.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Second, our practice of judgment in a culture that has embraced relativism</b>, that your truth is your truth and my truth is my truth, that absolute truths do not exist or at least are not transferable equally to others. Generally speaking in our culture, we commend those who do not judge. It is one of the most appealing aspects of Jesus’ message to the world at large, even to those who do not follow Jesus: “Judge not”. It is also one of the huge reasons that our neighbors who do not follow Jesus fail to recognize Jesus in the church: The church, in general, has a huge reputation for being judgmental. And, so does the culture, when you expose the right flaw. Donald Sterling, the billionaire ex-owner of the LA Clippers, has recently been exposed for his bigotry, racism, and hatred. Apparently, this was not particularly news for those in the know, but when those secret recordings were leaked to a gossip site, the league and the nation responded with outrage and, some, with hatred of their own. (See Swoboda.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This exposes, for the culture as well as the church, that we actually need values, truth, beauty – judgment. Judgment – God’s judgment – is based not on personal animosity or emotional reaction. God’s judgment is based on values, truth, and beauty. If values, truth, and beauty exist, then so does judgment. One of the values of our culture – that the culture associates with relativism but which the church locates in the love of God and the cross of Christ and the calling of a slave nation to be the people of God – is “inclusion” (our culture’s word) or, better, “welcome”, “hospitality”, “acceptance”. “Accept one another just as Christ Jesus accepted you” (Rom 15.7). In the church, we are called to hold the door open to everyone, including the enemy, whether Babylonian or Donald Sterling, inviting them to “turn and live”. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, in the language of Ezekiel, both “wickedness” and “righteousness”, “abomination” and “what is lawful”. Deep in our core as human beings, we know these things exist. Because they do, judgment exists – and hope exists.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Third, judgment across generations</b> (see Darr). For the exiles of Judah, it was perfectly normal to say, particularly when faced with Ezekiel’s preaching, “The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge” (18.2) and “Why shouldn’t the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?" (18.19). That’s exactly what they were experiencing, wasn’t it? Yes, in the grand scheme of history, and for their own sin. Even now, however, they have the choice between life and death. <b><i>They</i></b>have the choice. <b><i>We</i></b> have a choice. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we know that there is an inherited dimension of sin. In some great cosmic sense, biblical history places all human beings as present with Adam and Eve in the original sin. At the same time, biblical history places all who believe in the righteousness of Jesus. Beyond that cosmic level, however, there is tons of data for sin being passed along in family lines – domestic violence, addiction, bigotry. Ezekiel does not argue that fact; instead, he argues that we do not have to be defined by or judged for our heritage of sin. And, throughout Scripture, the implication is that the legacy of righteousness is more powerful than the legacy of sin. The legacy of sin may last to the third and fourth generation, but the legacy of righteousness lasts for a thousand (Exodus 20.5-6). Judgment <b><i>and</i></b>Hope.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a second dimension of judgment across generations that is addressed by Ezekiel. It’s not on the mind of the exiles, but he addresses it nonetheless. And that is fortunate, because it is often on our minds today: Will we be judged by the sin of our children? We heap lots of responsibility on ourselves for how our kids turn out, and parenting is a huge responsibility – and gift. However, at some point our kids grow up to make decisions on their own and to face the consequences as adults, and we can no longer protect them, and no longer be responsible for what they do. Even God, the best parent of all … even God’s kids Adam and Eve didn’t turn out quite the way God intended.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ezekiel declares, “A child shall not suffer for the iniquity of a parent, nor a parent suffer for the iniquity of a child” (18.20).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Fourth, judgment as earned, deserved, or “banked’</b>(see Darr). One of the old ways this was talked about in theology was a system of “merits” or demerits. If you watched or read any of the Harry Potter stories, you heard one professor or another announce points given to or deducted from one house or another. “Fifty points for Gryffindor!” Does God keep an accounting of our merits and demerits in this way? Can we “bank” on our goodness when it comes to the final judgment? Again, Ezekiel ventures beyond the primary focus of his audience to address a matter with which we struggle routinely: Do we have enough merits stored up to offset our failures, our sins? We live in doubt of our standing before God, uncertain of being forgiven.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ezekiel’s words on this subject are unequivocal and audacious. No, we cannot bank either our merits or demerits. If a wicked person repents, “None of the transgressions that they have committed shall be remembered against them; for the righteousness that they have done they shall live” (18.22). If a righteous person backslides, “None of the righteous deeds that they have done shall be remembered” (18.24).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ezekiel is not saying that our salvation depends on our works, or that our salvation depends on our most recent works. He is saying that our salvation, which is determined by God alone, is tied to the direction of our lives. “Repent and turn” (18.30). “Turn, then, and live” (18.32). “Get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit” (18.31). We are offered by God, not what we deserve, but what God desires to give us as we turn, as we allow God to make us new, as we repent. The reason sin is so deadly is not that God is waiting to zap us for any and every infraction. It is so deadly because we are walking away from the greatest gift of all – a new heart, a new spirit, life itself. And the further we walk away from life, the dead-er we become. As Ezekiel writes, “Iniquity will be your ruin” (18.30). But our God has destroyed the power of sin and death!
