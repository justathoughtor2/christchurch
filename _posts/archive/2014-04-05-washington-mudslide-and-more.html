The mudslide claimed the lives of 21 people, and about 30 people are still missing, according to recent news reports.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">UMCOR (The United Methodist Committee on Relief) is responding with an emergency grant to the Pacific Northwest Annual (regional) Conference to provide temporary housing needs, case management support, and spiritual and emotional care for affected families, as they try to make sense of this tragic event.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Bishop Grant Hagiya, of the Pacific Northwest Conference, called for prayer support following the disaster. The conference has asked churches to start collecting monetary donations for those who lost possessions and homes in the mudslide.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Please pray for healing, recovery efforts and strength for the days ahead.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">In addition, please pray for those affected by an 8.2 magnitude earthquake which struck off the coast of northern Chile yesterday, April 1. The quake triggered a tsunami which hit the shore with 6-ft. tall waves. About five people have died. UMCOR is monitoring the situation and has made contact with local partner EMAH, the humanitarian assistance arm of the Methodist Church of Chile.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;"><a href="http://www.umcor.org/UMCOR/Resources/Hotline-News-Archives/2014/April/UMCOR-Hotline-for-April-2?utm_source=src=0402hotline&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=unablesrc=0402hotline">Check out the UMCOR Hotline!</a></span></span>
