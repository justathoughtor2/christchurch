<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;">I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your support of the ministry of Christ Church in the first quarter of this year. We are growing in our generosity, carefully managing expenses, maintaining a healthy margin, and making regular payments of our Shares of Ministry. Thank you! <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;">Enclosed with this note is <span id="goog_423488568"></span>information on our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3kkrl3uip40sv0y/Capital%20Campaign%202014.pdf">capital appeal for 2014</a><span id="goog_423488569"></span>. Please give it prayerful consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;">Your support and your prayers are making a practical difference as we grow together as disciples of Jesus and invite others to follow Jesus with us. We continue to welcome new faces in worship. We had four small groups for adults sharing <i>The Prodigal God </i>journey together through Lent. Our congregational care team continues to grow. (We’ll hear a personal story from congregational care in worship on May 4). It is truly a delight to share in this ministry together.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;">For me, the huge highlight was our Easter Egg hunt. We had 130 children – not counting adults – celebrate the gift of Resurrection with us in the egg hunt, cup cake decorating, and singing. They came through the Ark and the Scouts, through personal invitation, and through posters in various community businesses. Our ministry team on that day included the whole range of generations here at Christ Church, from our youth to our great-grandparents. (One of our great strengths is our intergenerational faith community, with deep roots and a spirit of adventure.) For many families, it represents the opportunity to respond to Jesus and connect with his church in a fresh way. In the words of the famous song: “That’s what it’s all about!”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;">Thanks again for your generous support, your prayers, and for inviting your friends to connect with us as we seek to grow as disciples of Jesus Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: -.25in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.0pt;">Pastor JP</span></div>
