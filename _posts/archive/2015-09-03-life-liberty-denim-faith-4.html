Not really, but it was well known. When the Babylonians were about to attack Jerusalem, in a fit of desperation, the king set all the slaves free. But he changed his mind, put them all back in slavery, and got chewed out by the prophet Jeremiah (34.14; Walter C. Kaiser, Jr. <i>The New Interpreter’s Bible, Volume I: Leviticus</i>. 1171.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the leadership of Nehemiah, a governor of Palestine during the returns from exile, Jews set free all other Jews whom they had taken as slaves (Nehemiah 5.5).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Maccabees reports a city that could not endure a siege because it was in the Sabbath year, when no crops were sown (Kaiser, 1170). Archaeologists have found sales contracts that explicitly state that the sale is in perpetuity and not subject to the Jubilee provisions (Joel Shuman, conversation).<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Worldly treasures will all pass away” (“And So It Goes”). Yet, rather than embracing the truly subversive and counter cultural call of God, with its concrete economic and ethical implications, Israel bowed down to “Mammon”, the demon-god of wealth and security. Of course, they are not alone in doing so. Anyone else willing to be honest?<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Proclaim liberty throughout the land” (Leviticus 25.10). Inscription on the Liberty Bell (Kaiser, 1172). It is the American myth that we are the “land of opportunity”, that any person who works hard can make her own fortune. And every election cycle we repeat the old debate about limits to capitalism – whether or not they actually protect and promote opportunity for all. In our nation, we have many persons trapped in the cycles of poverty, without land or home to call their own, simply trying to stave off eviction or foreclosure. And, we have many others who pose as middle class but are enslaved by debt. Both parties appeal to the hard working people of our nation for their vote, but as a nation we continue to fail to “proclaim liberty throughout the land”, at least if that is to be assessed by the promise of Jubilee.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><a name='more'></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Joel pointed out last week, the holiness to which we are called is “nitty gritty”. That is, it has to do with the details of every-day life, with the recognition that our God is LORD of all and that our obedience to God will have practical consequences for everything from how we love our spouses to how we punch the clock at work, everything from how we raise our children to how we care for our yard. The biblical vision of holiness is holistic, large enough for all of life, the entire human race, the whole planet. That’s why we hear the refrain, repeated three times in the pastor and many more times in Leviticus 19 (last week’s focus text): “I am the LORD”. Holiness for the people of God flows directly out of the wholeness of the One Lord of heaven and earth. Holiness is not rooted in rules, but in the person and personality of God.<o:p></o:p><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Land<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]--><i>Sabbath Ecology</i> – not to abuse, over-work the land, but give it rest. When Israel ignores the Sabbath, whether it is the 7<sup>th</sup>day or the 7<sup>th</sup> year, and wanders from worship of the One LORD, they are promised (in Leviticus 26) that they will go into exile and that “the land shall enjoy its Sabbath years as long as it lies desolate” (26.34). If we do not allow the land to rest, the land, history, the hand of God, may force its rest upon us. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything needs rest. Rest is required to worship – for ancient Israel, the day of worship and the day of rest were the same. Today, without adequate rest, we cannot fully worship. Rest is required for fun. If we fill our calendars, even with good things, we will soon find ourselves not enjoying any of it. Rest, unstructured time (not just to sit on the couch and play video games), allows us to truly enjoy life.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We “honor the Sabbath and keep it holy” because God made us and all that is and rested on the Sabbath, and because God is the God of deliverance and freedom, who set free the slave people of Israel so that they do not have to serve a cruel task master, so that they can have true rest. And the Sabbath was not only for Israel the people but also for their land.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “If you don’t know where you’re going, it don’t mean a thing” (from the song) – a perfect description of a busy but purposeless life.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]--><i>Land Stewardship</i> – God owns the land, we care for it. “The land shall not be sold in perpetuity; with me you are but aliens and tenants” (25.23). It is not a resource for us to “use” but part of the Creation that God calls “good” (Genesis 1). Not only that, but there is a place on this earth for every person, even if they lack legal status or economic power. We are far too tied to legal paperwork that says something is ours. Palestinian Christians and Muslims are evicted from land that has been in their families for generations because no one wrote up the legal documents at that time. European settlers on this continent were quite happy to buy large tracts of land from the native Americans and then to simply evict them. Over and over, we have forgotten that God owns the land and we care for it, that it is not a resource for us to “use” but part of a good Creation, that there is a place on this earth for every person.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Liberty</b><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]--><i>Abolition of slavery</i> – while the Jubilee legislation recognizes that some people have to sell their labor to make a living and permits Israelites to own foreigners as slaves, it makes clear that even foreigners held as slaves are not to be treated as slaves but as human beings with dignity. “No one shall rule over the other with harshness” (25.46, and see other legislation protecting slaves form abuse and violence). And it gives special emphasis to the honor of the “chosen people” who are never to be sold to one another as slaves, and who – if they sell themselves to a foreigner – are to be redeemed as soon as possible. This legislation is practical, recognizing the economic structures of the time, and it contains within itself the hope for abolition of slavery for all people. “For to me the people of Israel are [slaves]; they are my [slaves] whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God” (25.55). If we are God’s slaves, then we are free from everyone and everything else.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: -1.0in -.5in 0in .25in .5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in 2.25in 2.5in 2.75in 3.0in 3.25in 3.5in 3.75in 4.0in 4.25in 4.5in 4.75in 5.0in 5.25in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in 7.0in 7.5in 8.0in 8.5in 9.0in 9.5in 10.0in 10.5in 11.0in 11.5in 12.0in 12.5in 13.0in; text-indent: -.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]--><i>Welcome for immigrants</i> – when God declares that Israel lives as “aliens and tenants”, that implies a certain welcome and compassion for the alien that lives among them. Despite the genocidal command to purify the land of Canaan by destroying all the people in it, we find this amazing command back in chapter 19: “The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God” (19.34).
