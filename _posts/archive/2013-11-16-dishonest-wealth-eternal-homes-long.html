You cannot serve God and wealth.</span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Luke uses this proverb to sum up the choices we must make.&nbsp; Wealth is not simply a material thing.&nbsp; It is also a spiritual thing.&nbsp; For many of us, it is a god, an idol, competing for affection, loyalty, and service with the God of the universe, our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The reality is that Jesus rules, that Jesus owns everything, that all we are and have is his gift.&nbsp; If we fully embrace this reality, then wealth has no power over us.&nbsp; And, its only value is how it connects us with God and with those in need.</span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that’s what we see in the story of the dishonest manager.&nbsp; It is a unique story, a bit problematic and frustrating, but pay attention to the manager’s plan and to the final line of the parable itself: </span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Luke 16:4 </b>&nbsp;I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.</span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Luke 16:9</b> I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes. </span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The only value to wealth is how it connects us with God and with those in need.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now, let’s take a few moments to talk about the difficulties in the story.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that the master – and, by implication, the story teller Jesus – commends the shrewd and dishonest manager for his quick thinking.&nbsp; Please note that this does not mean that the master, or Jesus, commends dishonesty, incompetence, or negligence in management.&nbsp; In fact, the master seems never to have gotten a course in how to hire and fire staff.&nbsp; He is the one who gives the dishonest manager a window of time to determine the terms of his own termination, rather than marching him out there and then, taking his keys, removing his name from the accounts and the company database.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Instead, the commendation of the dishonest manager is focused on two insights that can powerfully transform our lives.&nbsp; The first is that the value of wealth lies in connecting us to God and to those in need.&nbsp; The second is that it is not ours.&nbsp; It belongs to someone else.</span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager had lost sight of the last fact.&nbsp; He viewed his master’s money as a way to enrich himself, as a way to expand his own ownership stake.&nbsp; In his greed, he forgot that none of it belonged to him.&nbsp; But once he realized that none of it belonged to him, he didn’t need to worry about losing some of it, about reducing the debt owed to the master.&nbsp; He wasn’t going to feel the pinch, because it belongs to someone else.</span><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What would you do if you had access to a fortune that wasn’t yours?&nbsp; If you could use it any way you wanted, what choices would you make?&nbsp; </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I love the 2004 film <i>Millions,</i> a British comedy-drama for the whole family.&nbsp; The main character, 7-year-old Damian, has an active religious imagination and prayer life, is grieving the death of his mother, and withdraws regularly to a cardboard box fort in a remote field, near the train tracks.&nbsp; Someone throws a duffel bag full of money from a passing train, and Damian, in his box, finds it.&nbsp; He receives it as a gift from God, buys birds at the pet store to set them free, takes homeless folks out to dinner at Pizza Hut, stuffs money in the mail slot of some local missionaries.&nbsp; His brother Anthony, with whom he shared the money, hires the elementary school thugs as his posse.&nbsp; Things get interesting when they hear that the money was one of many bags from a recent bank robbery, and one of the thieves tracks them down.</span></div><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love the basic question: What would I do if I had access to a fortune that wasn’t mine?&nbsp; If everything I have isn’t mine anyway, if it is all God’s, well – it’s not a fortune – but I could have some fun with it!&nbsp; I like Damian’s approach: care for God’s creation, care for the poor, introduce people to Jesus “so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into eternal homes”.&nbsp; What we do here matters for eternity.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you are a fund manager today, your company gets a percentage of the fund each year in exchange for your management.&nbsp; That’s the way it was supposed to work with the dishonest manager.&nbsp; Only, he seems to have been taking more than his share.&nbsp; Some folks suggest that when he reduced what people owed his master, he was simply giving up his commission, his fees, that were part of the transaction (Fitzmyer 1098), investing for the long-term, not the short term.&nbsp; He probably did that, but it appears to me that he gave up his master’s wealth too.&nbsp; After all, according to the beginning of the story, he was “squandering his master’s property”.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kiplinger Top 25 no-load mutual funds for 2013 are low-expense funds.&nbsp; The diversified stock funds returned 20% or more this year and charged 1% or less.&nbsp; We don’t know the expense ratios for a manager in the ancient world.&nbsp; What we do know is that the basic expense fee for our management of the resources God invests with us is 90%.&nbsp; God gets 10%, we get the other 90.&nbsp; If we look at our giving in these terms, as a management fee for someone else’s fortune, we’re getting really good terms.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I realize that many of us are not tithing, the traditional biblical starting point for generosity.&nbsp; We’re not talking about this to make you feel guilty.&nbsp; We’re doing it to set our generosity, and our entire financial life, under the lordship of Jesus Christ, and to grow in our discipleship, to take the next step together.</span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Back to the story before us.&nbsp; The manager plays fast and loose with the master’s money, because he has nothing left to lose.&nbsp; He is a desperate man hoping to get his next job offer through the favors he gives out, and he’s hoping no one checks his references.&nbsp; Only now does he think about the future, only now does he look ahead with clarity on the consequences of his dishonesty and failure.&nbsp; We’ve all been there.&nbsp; Trying to get a major paper done at the last minute, reading those Cliff Notes instead of the actual assignment, cutting corners in the work place, trying to repair a breach of relationship because we were too impulsive, struggling with a bill that we cannot pay – because we already spent the money on something we don’t need.&nbsp; If only we had been thinking long term, we wouldn’t be in the fix we’re in.&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But though this man is looking to the future, it is still a limited time horizon.&nbsp; He’s only worried about the next job.&nbsp; The urgency and desperation overwhelm him and longer-range planning is simply out of the question.&nbsp; He is commended for his foresight.&nbsp; And, Jesus’ commentary is powerful: Live today so that you can be welcomed tomorrow into “eternal homes”.&nbsp; That’s true long-range planning.&nbsp; That’s a reminder that the value of wealth lies in connecting us with God and with those in need.&nbsp; And, it has this value, this power, because it is not ours.&nbsp; It belongs to someone else.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b><i>Our first four-letter word – Mine:</i></b> Jesse and the lollypop.</span></div>
