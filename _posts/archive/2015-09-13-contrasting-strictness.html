<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Some people consider the commandments of the Old Testament stricter than those of the New, but they are deceived by such a shortsighted interpretation. In the former, theft, not miserliness, is punished; wrongful taking of property is punished in the latter by fourfold restitution. In this place the rich man is not censured for having taken away someone elseâ€™s property but for not having sufficiently given away his own.
