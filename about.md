Jesus came "not to be served, but to serve" and we share the same calling in this community. We discover our purpose when we help each person discover and pursue their personal call. With a preference to see life unfold, we're throwing away the molds. Here, you can be the person you were meant to be...here you can be yourself.

People just like you form this church family, a family brimming with hopes and dreams. We come from all walks of life, and we are all drawn by a new awareness of God's love. New friends, new purpose, new life. Room for you.

## FAQ

**What should I wear?**<br />
Be yourself! You will find folks wearing everything from suits to denim.

**What about nursery care?**<br />
A nursery is provided for preschool children during the 10:45 worship service. Children are welcome in worship as well! Jesus put children at the center of his kingdom.

**How do you recognize guests?**<br />
We are always excited to see new faces, and we won't embarrass you! You will have an opportunity to register with the rest of the congregation on our "Friendship Pad". This helps us get to know you by name.

**Where should I enter the building?**<br />
From the parking lot (at the rear of the building), enter through the glass double doors. The sanctuary is straight ahead!

**Is Christ Church wheelchair accessible?**<br />
Yes!

**How do you serve Holy Communion, and can I partake as a guest?**<br />
We serve Holy Communion (the Eucharist) by "intinction". Each person is given a piece of the bread to dip in the cup.

In our tradition, **ALL are welcome to come to the Communion table**. Jesus is the host, and he invites each of us to repent and join the family feast. **Your children** are welcome to share in Holy Communion or to receive a blessing prayer. Those with **limited mobility** are encouraged to sit in the front two pews or to notify an usher to direct the servers to bring communion to wherever you are seated. We also offer a **gluten-free** alternative.
